xi</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Since the first appearance of this Handbook, and the larger
volume on the same subject, which the preface to the first
edition stated to be in contemplation, the Broad District has
become highly popular.&nbsp; Each year the tourist stream
increases, but, happily, there is still plenty of room.&nbsp; No
doubt some of the old <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>, who liked to have
the whole landscape to themselves, grumble at the change, but the
less selfish persons, who happily constitute the majority, do not
object to seeing a dozen yachts where formerly they saw but one,
or a score of anglers where in past years but half-a-dozen might
be seen.</p>
<p>A large trade has arisen in the letting of yachts, boats, and
pleasure wherries for cruising purposes; but the inn
accommodation has made little advance, and is still too meagre,
and insufficient for the demand.&nbsp; The yachts have made great
strides in speed and in number.&nbsp; The Norfolk and Suffolk
Yacht Club has flourished exceedingly, and its regattas are
popular.</p>
<p>Artists have found out the charm of the quiet scenery <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>of the
Broads, and visit us in great numbers.&nbsp; Notably Mr. E. H.
Fahey and Miss Osborn have given exhibitions in London devoted to
the district.&nbsp; Then <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> without
number have written magazine and newspaper articles, and others,
after a few days&rsquo; scamper, have written exhaustive
guide-books; and so the ball, which the present writer set
rolling in earnest some years ago, is helped merrily forward, and
the Rivers and Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk are fast becoming
one of the most popular of English playgrounds.</p>
<p>I should like to put the brake on a little in one
respect.&nbsp; One guide-book writer appears to treat the
riverside meadows as commons, and suggests that yachtsmen should
bring lawn-tennis sets and cricket materials with them.&nbsp;
Pray don&rsquo;t take such absurd advice.&nbsp; All riparian
owners adhere stoutly to their just rights.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that the rights of the public are limited to
<i>passage along</i> the navigable rivers and the navigable
broads, and the use of the banks of navigable waters for mooring
purposes and for towing.&nbsp; The soil of the greater part of
the river-beds is vested in the Crown, therefore angling is free
to the public.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, the shooting over the
Crown rivers is free, but this does not give persons a right to
shoot an inch over the banks.&nbsp; Looking to the fact that the
Bure is very narrow, and passes through private game preserves,
let me earnestly entreat visitors not to fire off guns either at
birds or at bottles (which last amusement appears to <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>be a
favourite one) above Acle bridge.&nbsp; The sport to the visitors
is <i>nil</i>, while the annoyance to the riparian owners is
extreme.&nbsp; The riparian owners are generally willing to
afford the well-behaved public all reasonable facilities for
enjoyment.&nbsp; Let this be repaid by the public refraining from
potting away at waterhens and pigeons, or other birds on the
banks.</p>
<p>It may be well to add that, up to about the year 1830, the
Broads and wet marshes were simply waste; but by the Enclosure
Acts and Awards, these watery commons were allotted and divided
among the neighbouring landowners.&nbsp; In some cases the rights
of navigation and staithes were expressly reserved.&nbsp; In
others no reservation was made, and the Broads are absolutely in
the hands of private owners.&nbsp; In other cases again, staithes
and rights of way have grown into disuse, and channels have
become choked up by mud and vegetation.&nbsp; In no case,
however, has the right of the Crown to the bed of the common
river been affected or changed by the Enclosure Awards.</p>
<p>A great point to remember is, that the possessors of the
Broads set as much store by their bulrushes and water lilies as
the admiring visitor; therefore, do not gather any off the
Broads.&nbsp; All flowers and grasses which grow in such
luxuriance by the riverside, within the river wall, or the three
yards from the river margin where the navigator has an
indefeasible right, may as well be gathered for pleasure as die
and rot.&nbsp; Here <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>there is abundance for everyone; but
to penetrate into quiet nooks of Broads and help oneself to other
people&rsquo;s valued property, is an indefensible act, which by
oft repetition has much irritated owners against the
public.&nbsp; It is in this respect also that visitors from a
distance are most prone to err, because, without reflection, it
appears that no harm is done.&nbsp; Nor would there be much harm
in a single instance, but &ldquo;many a little makes a
mickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a general rule, visitors from a distance behave exceedingly
well, being educated persons with a due sense of law and
order.&nbsp; The bottle shooters, coot potters, and noisy
revellers, the swan&rsquo;s egg robbers and grebe destroyers, the
persons who use one&rsquo;s boat-houses as luncheon rooms or dust
bins are, unfortunately, home products.&nbsp; Of course, I hear
of all offences that are committed, and by some people I am
actually saddled with the responsibility of any breach of good
manners on the part of the public, because I am supposed to have
brought the latter to the Broads.&nbsp; I therefore beg the large
unknown public (of whose friendliness to me as an author I have
had so many proofs), when they visit the Broads, not to allow the
exhilaration of an enjoyable holiday to interfere with a due
propriety of behaviour.</p>
<p>The hitherto unwritten rules of the Rivers and Broads are
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>Do not, in the neighbourhood of other yachts or houses,
indulge in songs and revelry after eleven p.m., even at regatta
times.</p>
<p><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>Bathe
only before eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, if in sight of
other vessels or moored in a frequented part of the river.&nbsp;
Ladies are not expected to turn out before eight, but after that
time they are entitled to be free from any annoyance.&nbsp; Young
men who lounge in a nude state on boats while ladies are passing
(and I have known Norwich youths to do this) may be saluted with
dust shot, or the end of a quant.</p>
<p>Adhere strictly to the rule of the road when boating,
according to the instructions contained in a subsequent chapter,
and when angling, moor out of the way of sailing craft, as
afterwards explained.</p>
<p>Do not throw straw or paper overboard to float to leeward and
become offensive; but burn, or take care to sink all rubbish.</p>
<p>Do not light fires, place stoves, or throw refuse on the banks
in the path of others, whose yachts may be moored to the same
bank.</p>
<p>Steam launches must not run at full speed past yachts moored
to the bank, particularly when the occupants of the latter have
things spread out for a meal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take guns on board unless you have leave to shoot
on somebody&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>Remember that sound travels a long way on the water, and do
not criticise the people you may encounter with too loud a
voice.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go on a friend&rsquo;s yacht with nailed shoes
(the commodore of a Thames sailing club once came on <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>board mine
in cricket shoes armed with spikes).&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t knock the
ashes out of your pipe into his boat, and don&rsquo;t catch small
fish and litter his decks with them, leaving them for him to
clean up after you.</p>

<a href="images/pxvi.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t moor outside another yacht without the permission
of its owner.</p>
<p>Ladies, please don&rsquo;t gather armfuls of flowers, berries,
and grasses which, when faded, you leave in the boat or yacht for
the unfortunate skipper to clear up.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t play the
piano in season and out of season (the reedbird&rsquo;s song is
sweeter on the Broads); and don&rsquo;t turn out before eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning when other yachts are near.</p>
<p>Observing all these simple maxims, any number of visitors will
find plenty of room for their own enjoyment, without offence to
anyone.</p>

<p>
<a href="images/dc17.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Decorative drop capital"

</a>It is somewhat difficult to analyse the charm which the
&ldquo;Broad&rdquo; District of Norfolk and Suffolk has for those
who have once made its acquaintance in the only way in which an
intimate knowledge of it can be gained.</p>
<p>In a journey through it by rail, you see nothing but its
flatness; walk along its roads, you see the dullest side of it;
but take to its water-highways, and the glamour of it steals over
you, if you have aught of the love of nature, the angler, or the
artist in you.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>One
reason may be that the rivers are highways.&nbsp; From them you
view things as from a different standpoint; along them flows a
current of life differing from that on either rail or road: the
wind is your servant, sometimes your master; there is an
uncertainty in the issue of the day&rsquo;s proceedings, which to
an idle holidaymaker is most delightful, and the slowly-moving
water is more like a living companion than any other inanimate
thing can be.&nbsp; Houses are few and far between.&nbsp;
Oftentimes within the circle of your sight there is neither house
nor man visible.&nbsp; A grey church tower, a windmill, or the
dark-brown sail of a wherry in the distance breaks the sense of
utter loneliness, but the scene is wild enough to enchain the
imagination of many.&nbsp; Long miles of sinuous gleaming river,
marshes gay with innumerable flowering plants, wide sheets of
water bordered with swaying reeds, yachts or wherries, boats,
fish, fowl, and rare birds and plants, and exquisite little bits
to paint and sketch&mdash;these are the elements out of which a
pleasant holiday may be made.</p>
<p>I wrote these lines whilst at anchor on Salhouse Little
Broad.&nbsp; The evening was most still and placid, and the boat
lay motionless among the lily leaves which covered the water
around.&nbsp; The white lilies had so closed their petals that
but the faintest morsels of white peeped out; but the yellow,
which were most numerous, did not close so completely, and the
dark interspaces of water were thickly starred with the golden
globes.&nbsp; Beyond <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the lily leaves was a belt of tall
reeds, swayed only by the birds which have their home among
them.&nbsp; The yellow iris flowers made the narrow neck of marsh
ablaze with colour.&nbsp; Bounding the view was a cordon of
trees; on the one side a wooded bank; on the other, but out of
sight, the river.&nbsp; A rustic boathouse nestled amid the
trees, white swans lighted up the dark shades, moorhens led their
broods across the pool; the western clouds were edged with sunset
glories, and the reflections in the water were as perfect as the
things they copy.&nbsp; But though there was absolute calm, the
lily leaves were not still, but moved tremulously, and sent
ripples on either side.&nbsp; Looking closely, you saw that the
leaves were covered with small insects, and the small roach were
busily plucking them off the under side.&nbsp; You could hear the
little snap or suck the fishes made, and once you caught the
sound you found the air was full of these snaps, and a most weird
effect the sound gave.&nbsp; The roach crowded eagerly round to
eat the crumbs that I threw them.&nbsp; So fearless were they,
that when I put my hand into the water and held it quite still
for a while, they came and snapped at my fingers, and funny
little tickling scrapes they gave.&nbsp; I actually succeeded in
grasping one or two of the boldest.&nbsp; A piece of paper, which
had been crumpled up and thrown on the water, was being urged to
and fro by the hungry little fish, who tried to find it eatable,
and tugged at it bravely.</p>
<p>The clouds darkened.&nbsp; I went into my cabin as a <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>squall of
wind and rain came on.&nbsp; The thunder grew louder and louder,
and there, alone, with the tempest raging, I could yet write that
the end of the evening was as pleasant as the beginning, so great
to me is the charm of the water.</p>
<p>I slung my hammock, hoping that on the following day the sun
would shine, the wind would blow, and the hours would pass as
quickly as the boat sailed, and slept as sound as man may.</p>
<p>It has happened that I have written a good deal about these
waters&mdash;too much, some people say.&nbsp; One result has been
that I have been pretty well overpowered with correspondence
arising from persons making enquiries about the district, with a
view to visiting it; therefore, when the publishers requested me
to write a kind of handbook or guide to the Broads and Rivers, I
thought it a good idea, in that enquirers might, by buying such a
book, save themselves the trouble of writing to me, and getting
necessarily short and inadequate replies.&nbsp; I am afraid,
however, the guide-book style is rather beyond me, and I shall be
most at home if I try to convey the requisite information by
describing one of the numerous cruises in which I have sailed as
guide to those friends who have trusted their holidays to my
care, and I will select one lasting but a fortnight, during which
time we covered most of the available ground.</p>
<p>Before doing so, a few words, descriptive of the situation of
these rivers and lakes, will not be amiss.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>From
Yarmouth, looking inland, three main water-highways
radiate.&nbsp; The chief is the Yare, flowing from the westward;
then comes the Bure, flowing from the north-westward, and having
her large tributaries, the Ant and the Thurne, flowing from the
northward.&nbsp; From the south-west come the clear waters of the
Waveney.&nbsp; All these rivers are navigable for considerable
distances, and on the Bure and its tributaries the greater number
of the Broads are situate.&nbsp; These Broads are large shallow
lakes, connected with the rivers, and are many of them
navigable.&nbsp; Flat marshes follow the lines of the rivers, and
while higher and well-wooded ground rises near the upper portions
of the rivers, near the sea the country is perfectly flat, and
vessels sailing on all three rivers are visible at the same
time.</p>
<p>The level of the marsh is frequently below that of the rivers,
and at the outlet of each main drain is a drainage pump, or
turbine wheel, sometimes worked by a windmill, and sometimes by
steam, which pumps the water out of the drains into the
rivers.</p>
<p>The fall of the river is about four inches to the mile.&nbsp;
The ebb and flow of the tide are felt for thirty miles inland,
but its rise and fall are very little indeed.&nbsp; There are no
impediments to navigation of any consequence, so it may be
imagined what a &ldquo;happy hunting ground&rdquo; this is to the
boat-sailor, the naturalist, and the angler.</p>

</a>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Wynne, &ldquo;that
these Broads are worth my giving up a few days to seeing
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give up a fortnight, I promise you that you
will find it too short.&nbsp; You went to the Friesland Meres

</a></p>
<p>So he promised to come for a fortnight, rather reluctantly,
and when, on his arrival in Norwich, he took a preliminary canter
by rail to Yarmouth, he refused to say anything about what he
thought of the country, which looked ominous.&nbsp; We had hired
a ten-ton cutter, and she was lying at Thorpe, a mile and a half
below the city.&nbsp; The man we had engaged rowed the jolly-boat
up for us, and as Wynne was enthusiastic about old buildings, we
rowed him up the river to the New Mills, a very old mill, which
spans the river Wensum near its <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>entrance into the city.&nbsp; From
thence we came back along the narrow sinuous river, overhung with
buildings, many of them ancient and picturesque, under numerous
bridges, wharves where wherries were loading or unloading, using
the half-lowered mast as cranes, past the Boom Tower, still
keeping watch and ward over the river; quaint Bishops&rsquo;
Bridge; Pull&rsquo;s Ferry, where there is a ruined water gate,
often sketched and photographed; past the railway station, into
the reach parallel with King Street, where gables, and archways,
and courts delight the painter.&nbsp; Here, on the left bank, is
another Boom Tower, built of flint, the universal building-stone
of Norfolk, faced by another tower on the opposite bank, whence
runs a fine piece of the old city wall up the hill <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to another
and larger tower, in better preservation, on the summit.&nbsp;
Then we next passed the very extensive works of Messrs. J. and J.
Colman, and below them innumerable stacks of choice wood, out of
which the boxes to contain the mustard, etc., are made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak of this as the Wensum,&rdquo; said Wynne;
&ldquo;I thought it was the Yare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This river is the Wensum, but this smaller stream
coming in on the right is the true Yare, and from this point the
united river takes the name of the Yare.&nbsp; This spot is
called Trowse Hythe, and half a mile up it, where there is a
mill, was once a famous spot for smelts, where they were caught
by large casting nets, used at <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>night by torch-light, but the town
sewage has effectually spoiled the smelting.&nbsp; The pool below
the New Mills was also a place where the smelts were caught in
large numbers, but it is not so good now.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p27.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Presently we came to Thorpe, where a bend of the river has
been cut off by two railway bridges, and a straight new cut made
for the navigation.&nbsp; We took the old river, and Wynne was
charmed with the view which then unfolded itself.&nbsp; The long
curve of the river was lined on the outer bank by picturesque
houses, with gardens leading to the water&rsquo;s edge, while
behind them rose a well-wooded bank.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1879
this reach was found to be swarming with pike, and it speedily
swarmed with anglers, who had generally good sport until,
apparently, all the pike were caught.&nbsp; At intervals since,
there have been similar immigrations of pike to this reach when
tides unusually high or salt drive the fish up from the lower
reaches.&nbsp; At the lower end of the reach is a favourite
resort on summer evenings, a waterside inn, known as Thorpe
Gardens, where we pulled up.&nbsp; Here there are also
boat-letting stations, where cruising yachts can be hired.</p>
<p>Just through the bridge, <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a> we joined the main
river again, and noticed several yachts moored against the bank,
amongst which was ours.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Wynne
stepped on board, curious to inspect a Norfolk yacht, and he
freely commented on her enormous counter, short keel, great open
well, and tall pole-mast.&nbsp; In a short time we stowed all our
belongings, and set sail&mdash;mainsail, jib, and
topsail&mdash;the spread of canvas rather startling Wynne, who
had only been used to sea yachts.&nbsp; There was a light
north-westerly wind, and we glided swiftly away before it.&nbsp;
But ere we had sailed a couple of hundred yards, Wynne insisted
on our stopping to sketch the White House, at Whitlingham, which,
with the trees on the hill, the wood-shaded reach of river, and
the huge brown sails of the wherries, formed a picture we might
well wish to carry away.&nbsp; Wynne often stopped in this way,
to the intense disgust of our man, who liked to make his passages
quickly, and had no sympathy with artistic amusements.</p>
<p>The dyke leading out of the river by the White House is a
regular harbour for pike, which is continually restocked from the
river.&nbsp; It is private property, but just at the mouth of the
dyke, in the navigable river, is a good spot.&nbsp; At least
three hundred pike were taken here last winter by Norwich
artisans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What graceful craft these wherries, as you call them,
are!&rdquo; remarked Wynne, as he rapidly sketched the
high-peaked sail of one which was slowly beating to windward or
&ldquo;turning,&rdquo; as the vernacular hath it, up the narrow
river.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p30a.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"A Norfolk Wherry"
title=
"A Norfolk Wherry"
src="images/p30a.jpg" />
</a>And he was quite right.&nbsp; There is not a line <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that is not
graceful about a Norfolk wherry.&nbsp; She has a long low hull
with a rising sheer to stem and stern, which are both
pointed.&nbsp; She has a tall and massive mast supporting a
single large sail which is without a boom, but has a very long
gaff launching out boldly at an angle of forty-five
degrees.&nbsp; The curve of the brown or black sail from the
lofty peak to the sheet is on all points of sailing a curve of
beauty.&nbsp; The wherries are trading crafts carrying from
twenty to fifty tons of cargo.&nbsp; They are manned generally by
one man, who sometimes has the aid of his wife or children.&nbsp;
They are nearly as fast as yachts, sail closer to the wind, and
are wonderfully handy.&nbsp; The mast is weighted at the keel
with one or two tons of lead, and is so well balanced that a lad
can lower or raise it with the greatest ease, when it is
necessary to pass under a bridge.&nbsp; Wherries are the most
conspicuous objects in a Norfolk broad landscape, and are in
sight for miles, as they follow the winding courses of the
rivers, often nothing but the sail visible above the green
marsh.</p>
<p>Very many of these wherries have been converted into sailing
house boats or pleasure barges, and so constitute most admirable
floating homes for those who like cruising with greater comfort
than small yachts can give.</p>
<p>It was an hour before we got under way again, and when, after
sailing down the long straight reach by Whitlingham, we came in
sight of the eminence known as Postwick Grove, Wynne wished to
land in order that <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>he might see the view from the top.&nbsp; The man burst
into open grumbling, so we asked him if the trip were undertaken
for his pleasure or ours, and on his reluctantly admitting that
it was for ours, we told him it was our pleasure to do as we
liked, and he resigned himself to his fate.&nbsp; The watermen on
these rivers are very civil, but they look with disfavour upon
anything which interferes with actual sailing.</p>
<p>Well, the view from Postwick was worth seeing.&nbsp; The
curving reaches of the river, animated with yachts, wherries, and
boats, lay beneath us, and the green marshes were bounded by the
woods of Thorpe, Whitlingham, and Bramerton, while the ruined
church of Whitlingham stood boldly on the brow of the opposite
hill.</p>
<p>Under way again, we presently reached Bramerton, where the
&ldquo;Wood&rsquo;s End&rdquo; public-house offers good cheer to
the wherryman and boating-man.</p>
<p>The pleasure-steamers which run between Norwich and Yarmouth
afford a quick but less pleasant way of seeing the river, and
stop at Bramerton nearly every day in the week.</p>
<p>Now the higher ground falls away from the river on each side
of us, and the belt of marshes widens, the river is higher than
the surface of the land, and the water is lifted out of the many
drains and dykes by means of turbine wheels, worked by the
windmills which form such conspicuous objects in the landscape,
and by more pretentious steam drainage mills.</p>

<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>Surlingham Ferry, 6 miles by river from Norwich, next
came into view.&nbsp; The house, with its picturesque gables,
lies in the shadow of a group of fine trees.&nbsp; A horse and
cart was being ferried across on the huge raft as we approached,
and the chain was only just dropped in time for us to pass.</p>
<p>There is a good inn at the Ferry, with limited but comfortable
staying accommodation; and excellent roach fishing is often
obtainable.&nbsp; The shore above the Ferry on the same side is
suitable for mooring yachts to, as there is a fair depth of water
close to the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What numbers of boats there are with people
fishing?&rdquo; said Wynne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they all catch
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, any quantity, as far as number goes, of roach,
and bream, and some good fish too, but the larger fish are caught
in the deeper water, lower down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coldham Hall is the next fishing station of importance.&nbsp;
There is a good inn there, and plenty of boats for hire at a
cheap rate.&nbsp; Fishing and other boats can also be obtained at
Messrs. H. Flowers and Co.&rsquo;s new boating station, where
yachts can be moored and laid up.&nbsp; As the railway station
(Brundall) is close to it, it is very convenient for
anglers.&nbsp; The mooring places at Brundall and Coldham Hall
are not many, as the banks are very shoal.&nbsp; In the reach
between Brundall and Coldham Hall only the middle third of the
river is navigable for yachts; and the same may be said of the
long reach below Coldham Hall.&nbsp; We could see <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>half-a-dozen
fishing boats under the lee of the point above the station.&nbsp;
It seems a favourite place, for I never passed it without seeing
fishermen there.&nbsp; But as the man had to sail the yacht round
the great curve of the river, we took a short cut across
Surlingham Broad in the jolly.</p>
<p>This Broad lies within a horse-shoe bend of the river, and has
a navigable channel across it.&nbsp; It is not deep enough,
however, for yachts or laden wherries.&nbsp; The Broad is largely
affected by the tide, which sometimes leaves its shallows
exposed.&nbsp; The river, as I should have said, is tidal up to
Norwich, and the force of the tide increases with every deepening
of Yarmouth Haven.&nbsp; We rowed up the dyke which leads on to
the Broad, a small sheet of water, overgrown with weeds and very
shallow, but a capital nursery for fish and fowl.&nbsp; The
fishing upon it is preserved.&nbsp; Rowing across it, we entered
another dyke, and emerged into the river again, and caught up the
yacht.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p36.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Snipe abound on the marshes here, and their drumming can
always be heard in the early summer.&nbsp; The flat, far-reaching
marshes glowed with a thousand tints of flower and grass, and the
iris gleamed brightly in the lush margins of the river.&nbsp; We
sailed quietly on, down the curving reaches of the widening
river, watching the slow-seeming flight of the heron, the splash
of fish, the bending reeds, and the occasional boat-loads of
anglers, until we came to the mouth of a dyke, about a mile long,
up which we again rowed in the jolly, to explore <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Rockland
Broad, where the open water is much more extensive than at
Surlingham.&nbsp; Here there are several eel-fishers&rsquo;
floating abodes, Noah&rsquo;s-ark-like structures, with nets and
&ldquo;liggers&rdquo; dangling about them.&nbsp; The fishing and
shooting on the Broad are, at present, open to all.</p>
<p>This Broad is also much affected by the tide, as,
notwithstanding its distance from the river, there are numerous
connecting dykes permitting easy flow and re-flow of water.</p>
<p>Back in the yacht again, we reached Buckenham Ferry (ten and a
half miles), a favourite angling rendezvous, with a railway
station of the same name close by.&nbsp; A long row of trees on
the left bank is the cause of daily trouble to wherrymen and
sailormen, as it shuts off the wind.&nbsp; The man who plants
trees by the side of a navigable river, where the navigation
depends upon the wind, is the very reverse of a benefactor to
mankind, and only selfishness or thoughtlessness can permit such
an act.</p>
<p>There is fair mooring for yachts just below the Inn, on the
same side, but they must be kept well off the shore by poles, or
as the tide ebbs they will strand and perhaps fall over.&nbsp;
The Ferry Inn is noted for its comfort; and its limited staying
accommodation is good.&nbsp; The fishing is very good both up and
down the river, and there are good boats for hire for fishing
purposes.</p>
<p>The river now becomes very wide and deep, and the shoals near
the banks, which abound in the higher <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>reaches, are not so frequent.&nbsp; I
would call the especial attention of the river authorities to the
disgraceful state of the river as far as Buckenham Ferry.&nbsp;
Each year the shoals and weeds increase, and the channel narrows,
until in some places not more than a third of the river-width is
available for the navigation.&nbsp; The natural consequence will
be that the navigation must gradually cease to be made use of, as
it becomes a matter of difficulty, and the railway will take the
trade, which might be kept to the river if a more energetic care
of the navigable stream were taken.&nbsp; This is a most serious
matter, and ought to be attended to.</p>

<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Next is
Langley Dyke, near which are the reaches of the river where the
principal regattas are held, and by the river side is Cantley Red
House (fourteen miles).&nbsp; Cantley railway station is very
close to the river, and as the water is deep close to the bank,
and there is some fairly firm ground, this is a favourite
yachting station, with good mooring to the banks.&nbsp;
Comfortable quarters may be had at the Red House, and the fishing
is good all about.&nbsp; A little lower down, on the same side of
the river, is another house, &ldquo;Peart&rsquo;s,&rdquo; where
one may obtain comfortable accommodation, and a
&ldquo;dock&rdquo; where small boats may be safely left.</p>
<p>We delayed so long on our way that the wind was falling, as it
usually does towards five o&rsquo;clock on summer days: the tide
had also turned, and we had it against us, so our progress was
slow.&nbsp; We passed the mouth of the Chet on our right,
navigable some four miles up to Loddon.&nbsp; Its mouth is marked
by Hardley Cross, which forms the boundary between the Norwich
and Yarmouth jurisdictions over the river.&nbsp; We barely made
headway as a public-house on the left, called Reedham Ferry, was
reached, and a little lower down we lay to against the
&ldquo;rond,&rdquo; or bank, and made all snug for the
night.&nbsp; A little further is Reedham village (eighteen
miles), which is picturesquely situated on high ground on the
north bank of the river.&nbsp; The railway station is close by,
and is the junction between the Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and Norwich
lines.&nbsp; There is staying accommodation <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>to be had at
Reedham.&nbsp; Yachts can be moored against the south bank above
the bridge, but should not be left unguarded, as the tide runs
strong, and wherries tacking through the bridge often jam up
against the bank.</p>

</a>The stove was soon alight, and the kettle on, while we walked
to the village for eggs and milk.&nbsp; As the gloaming deepened,
Wynne grew poetical over the scene of wide space there was about
us, filled then with an orange glow from the west, while the
swallows skimmed the river, and struck red drops of spray from
the surface.&nbsp; Then when the awning was spread over the stern
sheets, and the lamp lit up the snug cabin, Wynne smoked
contentedly, to the envy of the writer, who cannot smoke; and it
was later than it ought to have been ere we lay down in our
respective bunks, and were lulled to sleep by the ripple of the
water against the planks.</p>

REEDHAM TO YARMOUTH.</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/dc43.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

title=

src="images/dc43.jpg" />
</a>The next morning we were up betimes to take the last of the
ebb down to Yarmouth, and catch the tide up the Bure.&nbsp; As
there was a fresh breeze from the east, we had to tack nearly the
whole of the way.</p>
<p>At Reedham there is a swing bridge, over which the railway
passes, and if the wind is foul it is always a difficult matter
to sail through, particularly if the tide be against you.&nbsp;
On the present occasion we had the tide with us; therefore, on
reaching the opening of the bridge, we could shoot the yacht up
into the wind, and carry her way on until through, when her head
was paid off on the proper tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, these Norfolk waters are capital
places to learn to steer in.&nbsp; An inch either way, and we
should have torn our sail against the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what with getting the utmost on every <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>tack, without
going ashore, shaving wherries by a yard or two, and watching for
every puff as it comes over the grasses on the marsh, so as to
make the most of it, there is more fun in sailing here than on
more open waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just below the bridge is the <i>New Cut</i>, a perfectly
straight canal, three miles long, connecting the Yare with the
Waveney, and so saving a round of some eighteen miles, which
would otherwise be necessary to get from the one river to the
other, as a reference to the map will show.</p>
<p>Now came a steady beat for several miles, until we reached the
Berney Arms (on the right is the mouth of the river Waveney),
when Breydon water opened out before us, with Yarmouth in the
distance.&nbsp; When the tide is in, this is a remarkable sheet
of water, four and a-half miles long by a mile broad.&nbsp; There
are mud flats on either side of the wide channel, where herons
and sea-fowl greatly congregate.&nbsp; The strong wind against
the tide raises a respectable sea, and the tacks being longer we
made rapid progress, and the motion was exhilarating.&nbsp; A
sail across Breydon in a strong wind, is a thing I always
consider a great treat.&nbsp; The channel is marked out by stout
posts at intervals of two hundred yards or thereabouts, but it is
not safe to sail too close to all these posts unless the tide be
high, as the shoals stretch out beyond them, and, in default of
local knowledge, it is best to give them a wide berth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page45"></a><span

</a></p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The
spires of Yarmouth grow more distinct, and at last we arrived at
its quays, just as the tide was on the turn.&nbsp; We made fast
alongside a wherry moored to the quay, and while our man, with
the assistance of one of the loiterers on the quay, lowered the
mast, and quanted the yacht up the narrow mouth of the Bure and
under two bridges, we took a stroll about the quays, the quaint
&ldquo;rows&rdquo; and streets of the old part of the town, and
had a peep at the splendid church.</p>
<p>The ebb tide runs very strongly, and, to avoid being carried
against the bridge which spans the contracted harbour, it is
prudent for the stranger to have an anchor in readiness.&nbsp;
The public quays are on the north side next the town, and a berth
alongside a wherry or other yacht can be chosen.&nbsp; There are
private moorings laid down alongside the south shore off
&ldquo;Cobholm Island,&rdquo; and it is customary, in case of
need, to bring up to one of these, if vacant; but a yacht must
not be moored there, or alongside another yacht there, without
permission.&nbsp; If the visitor is nervous or inexperienced, he
can avail himself of the services of one of the watermen loafing
about the quays, to help him through the fixed bridges which
block the entrance to the river Bure, which here enters the
harbour.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p48.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Bream"
title=

</a>The river bends to the south at an acute angle with its
former course, and for about three miles runs very close to, and
almost parallel with the sea.&nbsp; It is interesting to row past
the wharves and quays, where many <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>quaint and picturesque bits present
themselves, but on account of the rapid flow of the tide, it is
not a part of the river much frequented by the river yachts.</p>

<a href="images/dc51.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

title=

src="images/dc51.jpg" />
</a>On going back to the yacht, we found that she was moored in
the North River, or Bure, having been quanted under the two fixed
bridges, and the mast was being slowly raised.&nbsp; The big pole
masts of these river yachts are very heavy and unwieldy, and I am
always glad when the operation of lowering and raising them again
is safely over.&nbsp; Sometimes they have lead weights
permanently fixed to the heel of the mast (which latter swings in
a tabernacle), but generally, lumps of ballast have to be shifted
and hooked on, a troublesome &ldquo;pinch-finger&rdquo; business
which I avoid in my own yacht by using a tackle and blocks.</p>
<p>Of course the wind was fair, as our course up the Bure lies
north for a mile or two, and then due west as far as Acle; and it
is well when it is fair, for the next twelve miles are very
uninteresting.&nbsp; There is nothing whatever <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to see,
except eel sets and boats.&nbsp; These Noah&rsquo;s-ark-like
craft are generally made out of old sea boats, with a hut built
on them.&nbsp; They are shoved a little way up a dyke, out of the
way of wherries, and the eel net is stretched across the stream,
waiting for the eels, in their annual migrations seawards, to
swim into it.&nbsp; Those two wooden buoys, one on each side of
the river, mark its position.</p>
<p>Almost at our first starting, we got aground; hard and fast
too, for the shoals are frequent hereabout.&nbsp; We waited for
the tide to float us off, and to help it we sent a rope ashore to
a man on the bank.&nbsp; The rope was not quite long enough, and
Wynne undertook to bend another to it.&nbsp; The man set all his
weight on it, the knot parted, and the man disappeared on the
other side of the embankment, where there was, we knew, a deep
ditch.&nbsp; Presently he reappeared, dripping wet, and in a
towering passion.&nbsp; He refused to assist us any more, so we
waited a little longer, and as the tide rose, we were again
afloat.</p>
<p>Once round the bend by the Two-mile House we sped away at top
speed to the westward, with frequent jibes as the river
bends.&nbsp; The great boom came over with tremendous force, and
made the yacht quiver again, although we eased it all we could by
rallying in the sheet.&nbsp; The low, dull banks passed rapidly
by, the only land-marks being solitary houses, known as the
three-mile, four-mile, five-mile, six-mile, and seven-mile
houses.&nbsp; Then we came to Stokesby Ferry, where there is a
group <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of
houses, which would make a picture, and an inn, where there is
tolerable accommodation, called the Ferry House.&nbsp; Then, on
the right, are some sluices, marking the entrance to the
&ldquo;Muck Fleet,&rdquo; a shallow, muddy dyke, only navigable
for small boats, which leads to the fine group of Broads known as
Ormesby and Filby Broads.&nbsp; Of these we shall have something
to say afterwards.&nbsp; A separate excursion has to be made to
them, as they do not come within the round of a yachting trip,
unless you drag your jolly over the sluices, and row the
four-miles-long Muck Fleet.&nbsp; Having once tried this
experiment, I cannot recommend others to do it.</p>
<p>A mile and a half further on, and we came to Acle bridge,
twelve miles from Yarmouth.&nbsp; Here is a fixed bridge, where
the mast has to be lowered.&nbsp; When we got through this we
stopped for dinner, and then, although we might have sailed up to
Wroxham with the wind before dark, we were fated to spend the
night here, in consequence of a freak of Wynne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In
the exuberance of his spirits, he attempted to jump a wide dyke,
using the quant as a leaping-pole.&nbsp; As a matter of course,
the pole sank deep into the mud, and when it attained an upright
position, it refused to depart from it, and so checked Wynne in
mid-air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is going to happen now?&rdquo; he exclaimed,
and after a frantic gymnastic exercise on the top of the quant,
it slowly bent, and finally broke, depositing Wynne on his back
in the middle of the dyke.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>We
fairly shrieked with laughter, and, as Wynne said, it served him
right, for laughing as he did at the man rolling into the ditch,
when the rope gave way.</p>
<p>As we had to get a new quant from Yarmouth, we had to wait
here until the morning, and amuse ourselves with fishing for
bream, of which large quantities may be caught here, and of good
weight.&nbsp; Acle is a capital fishing station, and is now
accessible from Norwich by the new line to Yarmouth, branching
off at Brundall.&nbsp; Acle is a charming village, and offers
many residential facilities to those who are fond of country life
and aquatic amusements.&nbsp; It is within easy reach of all the
best Broads, lying on the rivers Bure and Thurne, and not far by
water to Yarmouth.&nbsp; There are three good inns&mdash;the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Angel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most
convenient is the one by Acle bridge (the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo;),
kept by Mr. Rose, who well understands and can supply the needs
of yachting men and anglers.&nbsp; There is staying accommodation
at the inn, a wagonnette to meet the trains, fishing boats to
let, and every attention from the host.&nbsp; As there is good
mooring to both banks, especially above the bridge, and the river
is wide and deep, Acle is rapidly becoming a favourite yachting
and angling station.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Owing to the wide breadth of marsh there is a true wind for
sailing, and the reaches above Acle to Thurnemouth are wider and
finer than any other parts of the Bure.</p>

</a>The wind, on the next morning, was from the north-west, a
head wind for us, and there was little of it; so little, indeed,
that we could not stem the tide, and had to quant for three
miles.&nbsp; Then we came to the mouth of the river Thurne,
leading to Hickling Broad, up which we intended to sail on our
return from Wroxham.&nbsp; The Bure turns off sharply to the
west, and as the wind gradually gained in strength, we were able
to dispense with the unwelcome labour of quanting.</p>
<p>The first noteworthy spot that we came to was St.
Benet&rsquo;s Abbey, situated on the north bank of the
river.&nbsp; Once upon a time it must have been a mighty
building, covering much ground, as its scattered ruins
testify.&nbsp; Now nought reminds us of its founder, sensible
King Canute, but a fine archway, with some contiguous walls, upon
which a windmill has been erected, but which is <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>now itself in
ruins, and two massive parallel walls, standing about two hundred
yards to the eastward; also, there are arched doorways, and
strong walls in the house by the riverside, whose cool recesses
speak of ancient days.&nbsp; This house was once a public-house;
we landed to get a drink of buttermilk, and lay in a store of
eggs and butter.&nbsp; We also climbed to the top of the ruined
arch, whence a wide prospect is visible, and one may count a
goodly number of churches.</p>
<p>Opposite the ruins is a dyke, down which a wherry turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does that lead to?&rdquo; asked Wynne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To South Walsham Broad, which is a mile and a half down
it; and, although wherries can sail down, this boat, which draws
about five feet six inches, cannot.&nbsp; Still, we can go down
in the jolly, or, if you like, stay here, and fish for
perch.&nbsp; This is a noted spot, because there is a hard
gravelly bottom, and, by the way, we might have stopped at Thurne
mouth, which is a good place for pike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like exploring these dykes, so I vote we go down to
the Broad.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p58a.jpg">
<img alt=
"Cottage, South Walsham Broad"
title=
"Cottage, South Walsham Broad"
src="images/p58a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>So we started, and overtook the wherry, which had been
aground, and she gave us a tow down.&nbsp; The Broad, which was
formerly one sheet of water, has, by the growth of reeds and
plants, been divided into two portions.&nbsp; There was nothing
particular to be seen in the first one; but on rowing into the
further Broad, we saw <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>a cottage on the right bank, which,
with its long, low thatch, deep eaves, its honeysuckles and
roses, its trees and its landing-place, formed a most tempting
object for a sketch, and one the artist would do well to
seek.&nbsp; The Broad is private, save for the navigation across
one part of it to South Walsham, and the fishing is
preserved.&nbsp; The old course of the river formerly made a
horse-shoe bend down towards South Walsham, and the present
straight channel by the Abbey ruins is an artificial cut.&nbsp;
The site of the Abbey is an island of solid ground in the midst
of a great extent of marsh.&nbsp; When we got back to the boat we
saw the man fast asleep on the counter, with his rod in the
river, in tow of a large perch, weighing one pound and a half,
which we secured.</p>
<p>About a mile further, on the right hand, as we ascend the
river, is the mouth of the river Ant, leading to Barton Broad and
Statham, of which more anon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river is getting uncommonly pretty,&rdquo; said
Wynne, &ldquo;and this slow tacking enables me to see it to
advantage, eh!&nbsp; How close we steer to the fishing boats!
and, pray tell me, why do fishermen in Norfolk wear such
extraordinary hats!&nbsp; Here is another dyke.&nbsp; Can we sail
down it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only drew four feet of water, we could go on to
Ranworth Broad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, on my next cruise here, I will get a yacht that
does not draw more than a wherry does.&nbsp; It is absurd to have
such deep draught yachts where there are so many shallows.&nbsp;
Let us row down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Ranworth Broad is a very pretty Broad, but grown up so
that it is divided into two.&nbsp; The eastern half is navigable
to the village of Ranworth, but otherwise private, as is the
other portion of the Broad.&nbsp; This is very strictly
preserved, on account of the wild fowl which frequent it.&nbsp;
It is a favourite fishing place, although permission has first to
be obtained from the owner, who, however, cannot be expected to
give leave indiscriminately.&nbsp; It is not worth while seeking
to fish in private waters in this district, for other fish than
pike, seeing that the free fishing in the rivers is as good as
any one could wish for.&nbsp; From the eastern part of the Broad,
a very pretty picture, with the church in the background, on a
wooded height, is visible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p60.jpg">
<img alt=
"Horning Village"
title=
"Horning Village"
src="images/p60.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then to Horning Ferry, where, as we approached, a horse and
cart were being ferried across, and we had to <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>lie to for a
few minutes, until the huge raft was safely across, and the chain
lowered.&nbsp; The public-house at the ferry is a very
comfortable one, with a nice sitting-room and garden in front,
and is a capital place to make one&rsquo;s head-quarters.&nbsp;
It is about nine miles drive from Norwich, and four from Wroxham
railway station.&nbsp; A little further on is Horning village, a
picturesque group of houses, straggling along the river bank,
with a large windmill on the hill behind, making a good
picture.&nbsp; Here our ears were greeted with the song which,
for generations past, the small children of the village have
chanted to passing yachts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ho! John Barleycorn: Ho! John
Barleycorn,<br />
All day long I raise my song<br />
To old John Barleycorn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is all.&nbsp; It is simple and effective, and extracts
coins from too easily pleased holiday-makers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p60a.jpg">
<img alt=
"Ranworth Church"
title=
"Ranworth Church"
src="images/p60a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The river turns to the left, at right angles to its former
course, as it passes the village, and on the north bank is a
reedy sheet of water, called Hoveton Little Broad, where there is
a small colony of the black-headed gulls.&nbsp; On the south side
is a small, but pretty Broad, called the Decoy Broad.&nbsp; Then
the river turns still more sharply to the left, and we sailed due
south, after having come due north by Horning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a number of anglers there are!&rdquo; said Wynne,
&ldquo;and the singular thing is, that they always seem to be
catching fish.&mdash;How many have you caught?&rdquo; he called
out to two fishermen in a boat.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;About six stone, sir,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;but we have been at it since daylight, and they bite very
slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I think Norfolk a very favoured county, with
all these splendid rivers and free fishing; and one place seems
as good as another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as long as you pick deepish water, and get under a
lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they groundbait the place where they
fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before they come, but while fishing they throw in a
good deal of meal, mixed with water and clay.&nbsp; If they were
to groundbait one or two suitable places on both sides of the
river, so as to be sure of getting a lee, for a day or two before
they fish, they ought to get even more than they do now.&nbsp;
Here is a boat-load trailing for jack.&nbsp; Ask how many they
have caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wynne did so, and the reply was, &ldquo;Fifteen, but all
small: they run from two pounds up to seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People here either fish for pike with a live bait or
trail with a spoon.&nbsp; You rarely see anybody spinning by
casting, or even using a dead bait on a spinning flight.&nbsp;
Now, I know that in the hands of one or two people, a paternoster
has proved very deadly.&nbsp; With three large minnows on your
tackle, and roving about close to the bank, you may get many pike
and perch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it in the morning before
breakfast,&rdquo; said Wynne.</p>
<p>In another mile the river again turns westward.&nbsp; On the
north is a very large Broad, called Hoveton Great <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Broad, whence
comes the clangour of a large colony of black-headed gulls.&nbsp;
The Broad is not navigable for anything of greater draught than a
small sailing boat; and now all access to it has been barred by
chains across the dykes, and it is strictly preserved, chiefly in
consequence, it is said, of the disturbance of the gulls by
visitors.&nbsp; The gulls flew, screaming, overhead, in a white
cloud, so that the air seemed filled with them, and the
half-grown young ones floated on the water, as lightly as
thistle-down.&nbsp; Although this colony is nothing like so large
as the famous one at Scoulton Mere, near Hingham, in Norfolk, yet
it is extremely interesting, and particularly when the eggs are
being hatched off, and the little fluffy brown balls, which
represent the young birds, are running and creeping about the
reeds and grasses, and swimming in and out of the water-divided
tussocks.&nbsp; Air and water and grasses seem thrilling with
abundant life, and the ear is deafened with abundant noise; a
noise, however, which, discordant as it is, has for a naturalist
the music of the nightingale.&nbsp; The water is very shallow at
the east end, where the gulls are, but the soft mud is of an
exceeding great depth.</p>
<p>Some years ago the American weed, <i>Anacharis
alsinastrum</i>, that pest of our inland waters, so completely
filled this Broad, that a duck could walk upon the surface.&nbsp;
It then suddenly decayed, at the same time poisoning the fish so
that they died by thousands.&nbsp; Since this time the Broad has
been comparatively free from it.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>During
Wynne&rsquo;s visit the Broad was still open, and we visited it
in the jolly.&nbsp; After rowing about for some time, we turned
to go back to the yacht, and Wynne said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
the sails of the yacht anywhere.&nbsp; Where can she have
disappeared to?&nbsp; I know that the river is over there,
because there is the sail of a wherry over the reeds, but there
is no channel through the reeds, and it is no use your rowing
that way.&nbsp; You have lost your way, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We only laughed at him and rowed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that there is no way into the river
here.&nbsp; Oh, yes, there is; I beg your pardon, but I should
have rowed about until doomsday before I found the way
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you couldn&rsquo;t have landed, for I don&rsquo;t
think there is a bit of solid ground all round the Broad.&nbsp;
But where is the yacht?&rdquo;&nbsp; For there was no sign of
her.</p>
<p>The wide opening on the opposite side of the river suggested
that perhaps the man had taken her on to Salhouse Broad.&nbsp; So
we rowed on, disturbing a kingfisher, which was perched on a
bullrush, and there was a picture.&nbsp; Wynne cried,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>!&rdquo; with delight, and,
although I have seen the like so many times, the scene is always
fresh in its beauty.&nbsp; On the placid bosom of the small lake
the yacht lay motionless, while a pair of swans, with their brood
of cygnets, swam near her.&nbsp; Outside the ever-present
boundary of green reeds, was a darker circle of trees, and crowds
of yellow lilies made a bright bit of colour in the
foreground.&nbsp; On the further <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>shore was a thatched boat-house, and
behind it a wooded bank.&nbsp; The thud of the jolly against the
yacht&rsquo;s side aroused a wild duck; a shoal of rudd broke the
still surface, as they sprang from a pursuing pike, and the
red-and-white cows, which had pushed through the reeds to drink,
stood looking at us contemplatively.</p>
<p>We dropped the anchor, and got tea ready, and Wynne worked
hard at a water-colour sketch, brush in one hand, bread and
butter in the other, palate, plate, and sketch-block mixed up,
and the brush going as often into his teacup as into the mug of
water.</p>
<p>After tea, we landed, and walked into the long and straggling
village of Salhouse, in search of bread and fresh meat, and on
our return, climbed to the top of the bank, whence a fair
prospect met our eyes.&nbsp; At our feet were Salhouse Broad, and
the smaller Broad next to it, which I call Salhouse Little Broad,
a lakelet covered with water lilies; outside these, the sinuous
river, doubling upon itself, as though loth to leave so pleasant
a land; Hoveton Broad to the right, and Wroxham Broad to the
left; many white sails flitting about on the latter, and more
yachts coming slowly up the river.</p>
<p>There is a navigation across Salhouse Broad to Salhouse
Staithe, but the present owner of the Broad discourages sailing
upon it, and the reader is advised not to anchor or moor
there.&nbsp; The old times when one could come and go upon the
Broads as a matter of apparent right are now past.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>We went
to Girling&rsquo;s farm, close by, to get milk, and eggs, and
butter, and I may mention that Mr. Girling has comfortable rooms
to let, suitable for a family, whilst the situation is
unsurpassed for prettiness.</p>
<p>We quanted off the Broad, and found just sufficient air moving
on the river to take us gently on.&nbsp; We had a little surprise
in store for Wynne.&nbsp; As we came up to Wroxham Broad, I asked
him to reach me something out of the cabin.&nbsp; When he was
safe inside, I put the helm up, and we slipped through the
&lsquo;gatway&rsquo; into the Broad.&nbsp; When Wynne came out of
the cabin, instead of the river banks, he saw the wide-stretching
Broad, the Queen of the Broads, for her beauty, size, and depth
of water combined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is lovely.&nbsp; I had no idea that we had left
the river.&nbsp; What a string of fishing boats!&nbsp; Are they
having a match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Angling matches are very favourite
amusements here, and the prizes are sometimes valuable, and
sometimes very miscellaneous in their nature.&nbsp; They are very
sociable, well-conducted gatherings, and I think the Norfolk
anglers would meet with old Izaak&rsquo;s approbation, as being
honest and peaceable men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all look very happy.&nbsp; But, tell me, are there
always so many yachts here as there are to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&nbsp; The fact is, there is a regatta of the
Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club here to-morrow, and it is always a
genuine water frolic.&nbsp; This is a favourite <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>place at all
times; Wroxham is only seven miles by rail from Norwich, and the
Broad is only a mile and a half from Wroxham by water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We drifted across to the other side of the Broad, and there
dropped our anchor, and made all snug.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening, and yacht after yacht came upon the
Broad, and anchored; anchoring, by the way, meaning, in the
majority of cases, dropping some pigs of ballast overboard, at
the end of a rope, for the mud is so soft that an ordinary anchor
would drag through it.&nbsp; We visited our friends on various
yachts, and then the moon shone so brightly out of a cloudless
sky, that, late as it was, we did not turn in for a long time,
but floated about in the boat, and yarned about old times, until
it was very late indeed.</p>

</a>I had scarcely closed my eyes, it seemed to me, ere I was
awakened by Wynne moving about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to paternoster for perch, and I&rsquo;ll
take the casting-net to get some small fry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! why can&rsquo;t you wait until the
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is morning.&nbsp; It is four o&rsquo;clock and broad
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go, and don&rsquo;t come back until breakfast
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I drew the curtains over the windows, and
tried to think it was quite dark, and to get to sleep again.</p>
<p>On awaking I heard the sound of a piano.&nbsp; My first
thought was, &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;&nbsp; I found that I was
on the boat, sure enough, and it was seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
There was no more sleep for me, for a wherry, fitted up as a
yacht, was lying near, and her crew had not only got a <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>piano on
board, but played upon it at seven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; It is an excellent plan to rig up a wherry in this
way for a cruise, as good accommodation for a large party is
secured, and the interior can be well divided into several
sleeping-rooms.&nbsp; The presence of ladies aboard the wherry,
and up so early, was rather a nuisance, as one had to row away
for one&rsquo;s dip.&nbsp; Up to eight o&rsquo;clock, the Broad
is generally sacred to the men, who can take their plunge
overboard with safety.</p>
<p>Presently Wynne came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two jack, about five pounds each, and three perch,
about a pound each.&nbsp; If I could have got some minnows I
should have done better, but the roach I got were too large for
paternostering, and not lively enough.&nbsp; I got into a row,
too.&nbsp; I found a bow net set among the weeds, and there were
three large tench in it.&nbsp; As I took it up to look at it, its
owner appeared, and slanged me considerably at first; but when he
cooled down, he got talkative, and told me that the reaches of
the river by Salhouse and Hoveton Broads are the best for pike,
but that all the way down to Horning Ferry is good.&nbsp; By the
way, I saw a lot of boats fishing on the Broad when I set out,
and they went on to the river when they saw me.&nbsp; The Broad
is not preserved, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but one of the owners, Mr. Chamberlin, levies a tax
of 2s. 6d. on fishermen, and as it goes to the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital, one ought to pay it <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>willingly.&nbsp; Poor men can&rsquo;t
pay it, so they fish on the Broad in the early morning, and then
leave for the river.&nbsp; They walk here from Norwich,
overnight, and begin to fish before daylight, and as they can get
a boat at Wroxham for a shilling a day, it is not an expensive
pastime for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw some notice boards at Salhouse, but there was so
much on them, and the letters were so small, that I could not
read them, but I suppose they were meant to warn people
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is unfortunately too great a disposition
amongst owners to try and close the Broads against the fishing
public, and even to interfere with the old navigation rights, but
there are praiseworthy exceptions, and here comes one, the owner
of this end of Wroxham Broad.&rdquo; <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>As the
sun rose higher, so it grew hotter in too great a ratio, and the
breeze was too light to afford much excitement in the way of
racing.&nbsp; Still, it was a wonderfully pretty sight, such as
could be seen on no other English inland water, save Windermere:
the yachts, too, are very much like the Windermere yachts, but
carry even more canvas than the latter do.&nbsp; The following
are the dimensions of a 10-tonner of that time: length on keel,
25 feet; over all, 34 feet; beam, 10 feet.&nbsp; Ordinary canvas
would be, mainsail luff, 23 feet; head, 28 feet 6 inches; foot,
35 feet, and leech, 42 feet; jib, leech, 23 feet; foot, 36 feet;
and luff, 48 feet, with a topsail yard of 23 feet.&nbsp; For
racing, these dimensions are largely increased.&nbsp; For fast
sailing and quick turning to windward, these boats are justly
celebrated, but the Broads are so rapidly growing shallower, that
their draught, about five feet, closes many of the Broads to
them.&nbsp; A much more sensible type of a large boat for <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>pure comfort
in cruising (though not for sport in sailing) is one founded on
the wherry plan, with a large mainsail, and drawing not more than
three feet of water.&nbsp; For such boats under 10 tons, the
&ldquo;Una&rdquo; type is the best.&nbsp; Its shallow draught
would enable it, with the centre-board up, to go anywhere, and
penetrate into the most charming recesses of this wild country,
which the deeper yacht can never see.&nbsp; Its beam gives
safety, and also minimises the inconvenience of the centre-board
case in the cabin, and a high booby hatch would give
head-room.&nbsp; The one sail is very handy, and if her owner has
but ordinary skill and energy, he could sail her alone, and so
dispense with the expense of keeping a man.&nbsp; Without this
expense, yachting in these waters is a reasonable and very cheap
amusement.&nbsp; These remarks are for the benefit of the great
number of people who have written to me at one time or another,
to know what facilities for economical boat-sailing and living
exist in these waters.&nbsp; For fast sailing and ease of
handling by a <i>skilled</i> person, the present improved type of
sloop or cutter cannot be surpassed on any waters.</p>
<p>Well, 10-tonners and 4-tonners, open cutter-rigged
sailing-boats of a very fast type, canoes with battened sails,
luggers and boats, and wherries sailed to and fro, and steam
launches puffed noisily about, and marred the beauty of the
scene, as well as upset the glasses and dishes of breakfast or
luncheon by the swell which they caused.&nbsp; The people paid
very little attention to the <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>racing, but set themselves heartily
to enjoy this great water picnic.</p>
<p>Wynne went ashore, and discovered some pretty woodland vistas,
with glimpses of the Broad, and the glancing sails between leafy
boughs of oaks, and under lofty arms of Scotch firs.&nbsp; Also,
he discovered that at the farm at the lower end of the Broad,
Mrs. Newman&rsquo;s, there were rooms to let, and that an artist
friend of his had taken them, so there he stayed for a long time,
and kept the jolly, in spite of vigorous hails for it.</p>
<p>Of the adventurous journeys of yachts up to divers Wroxham
Regattas, of the exploits of elated yachtsmen, and the mishaps of
careless ones, of the fun and merriment attendant on these annual
gatherings, the writer has written in another place.&nbsp; At
present, we must hurry on.</p>
<p>In the evening we sailed, or rather quanted, up to the
Bridge.&nbsp; These reaches of the river were lovely in the
extreme.&nbsp; The clear and brimming river reflected the
marginal flowers and groups of trees, while acres of marsh shone
with the yellow iris flowers.&nbsp; But, alas! the woods and the
sloping fields kept off the wind, and made one wish that the
<i>upper</i> entrance to the Broad were widened and made
navigable.</p>
<p>We came to the Bridge at last, and moored to the bank,
watching the homeward-bound holiday makers arrive in yachts, and
boats, and wherries; a goodly number of the latter having
numerous passengers.</p>

</a>The bridge at Wroxham is very narrow and low.&nbsp; The mast,
of course, had to be lowered, and the yacht quanted under the
road and railway bridges.&nbsp; A wherry passing under raised her
mast too soon, and damaged the ornamental vane, which consisted
of the inevitable figure of a Welsh girl with a high hat and
holding a bunch of leeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I must have a new Welsh girl,&rdquo; said the
wherryman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is such an emblem chosen in Norfolk, of all
places?&rdquo; asked Wynne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some thirty years ago there was a wherry named after
the famous Jenny Morgan of the song, and she had such a
vane.&nbsp; It took the fancy of the wherrymen to such an extent
that they all adopted it in the course of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The river here is very narrow, and Wynne, who was <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>steering, put
the yacht &ldquo;on the putty&rdquo; twice, before he could be
induced to give up the helm to the man, who professed to know the
exact depth of every part of the river.&nbsp; The river makes a
very long loop to the south, just above Wroxham.&nbsp; In this
loop is Belaugh Broad, said to hold some very large carp, but it
is preserved.&nbsp; On the neck of the loop, on a high bank,
stands Belaugh Church, a prominent object for some miles, as you
follow the river.&nbsp; It is very picturesquely situated, and
the view from it is characteristic.&nbsp; Close by the church is
a draw-well, with a pent-house over it, well worth
sketching.&nbsp; There is a pretty backwater, or old channel of
the river, near here, called &ldquo;Little Switzerland,&rdquo;
which is worth rowing up, but unfortunately the owner objects
even to artists visiting it, and hence it must be considered as
sacred ground.</p>
<p>It came on to blow very hard, as we finished the three-mile
loop of river, half a mile from where we entered it, and as the
wind was fair, the corners sharp, and the river narrow, we
lowered the mainsail, and ran up under the jib alone, to
Coltishall, where we at once made a rush for the butcher&rsquo;s,
just in time to secure a piece of meat for our dinner to-morrow,
which, being Sunday, we intended to spend at Coltishall.&nbsp;
The village is superior to most Norfolk villages, and contains
some old houses with rounded gables, and a fine church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The great business of the place is malting, and many men
labour as maltsters in winter and boat-builders in <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>summer, so
that summer is the time to get a boat built at Coltishall, when
either Allen or Collins will build you one at a reasonable
rate.</p>
<p>The fishing is very good in this portion of the river, and
there are great numbers of jack here, although they run rather
small.&nbsp; In the spawning season, the bream head up here in
large numbers, and as there is no close season in Norfolk, many
anglers follow them up.</p>
<p>The first lock on this river is just above the village, and on
the bye-stream stands Horstead mill, a very fine specimen of the
Norfolk water-mill.&nbsp; It stands upon <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>arches, and
the stream runs under it, the wheels, of course, being
undershot.&nbsp; It makes a very effective picture, seen from
below, and, in fact, if you row your jolly up the left-hand
stream, as you go up, you will see very many lovely bits worth
the painter&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; I have photographed some of
them, as I can&rsquo;t sketch, but photographs cannot depict the
colour.&nbsp; It is in the soft living light of these Norfolk
scenes that their chief beauty lies, but they cannot be depicted
without the aid of colour, and only imperfectly then.</p>
<p>The river is navigable for wherries and yachts drawing but
little water, right up to Aylsham, some eleven miles further; but
there are two more locks before reaching Aylsham.</p>

</a>Wynne had undertaken the office of steward, and so far we had
fared sumptuously, but as we were tidying up on Monday morning,
the fact became apparent that the provision lockers were nearly
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought there
would be a better chance of buying things, as we went along, than
there appears to be, for with the exception of butter and eggs,
we might as well be on the prairies.&nbsp; What shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, provisioning is a very perplexing thing, particularly
when it is for several days, and as I knew that at Norwich
made-up hampers of provisions for fishing-parties could be
obtained, we telegraphed for one to be sent to us at Wroxham
station, and departed in hope, with a light but fair wind.&nbsp;
We trailed a pike-bait behind, and caught several jack, and two
or three good <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>perch.&nbsp; We were three hours getting to Wroxham, and
while the mast was being lowered, Wynne went to the station to
meet a train then coming in.&nbsp; He returned in glee with a
hamper of good things, and our difficulty was at end.&nbsp; Once
we spent a Sunday at Wroxham, with nothing procurable to eat but
biscuits, and once, at Barton, we were obliged to fish for our
meals.&nbsp; Meat so soon goes bad on board a boat, and one does
not always care for tinned things.&nbsp; A good wrinkle is to
have a bottle containing a strong solution of permanganate of
potash on board, and then a few drops placed in a pint of water
will make a most efficient deodorising liquid, with which you may
safely sprinkle the meat, and wash out the lockers.</p>
<p>As the day advanced, the breeze got up, and by two
o&rsquo;clock we were at the mouth of the river Ant, ten miles
from Wroxham.</p>
<p>As we turned up its narrow and shallow waters, our man
said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t get very far up this river, sir, with a
craft drawing so much water as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we can get to Ludham Bridge, and there I have
arranged for an old lateener to be waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>

<img class='floatleft' alt=

</a>We touched the ground several times before we got to the
bridge, about a mile up, thus showing that a very fine Broad is
practically closed to the possessor of a large yacht of the usual
type.&nbsp; We left the yacht below the bridge in charge of the
man, and Wynne and I <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>transferred ourselves on board a
six-ton lateener, very broad and very shallow, with bluff bows; a
boat sixty years old, if a day, only drawing about two feet of
water.&nbsp; She had an enormous lateen foresail, and a mizen,
and she subsequently formed a picturesque object in Wynne&rsquo;s
sketches.&nbsp; A wherry was coming through the low and narrow
bridge, and, as the water was high, she had some difficulty in
doing it.</p>
<p>The wind was fair for a large portion of the way, and we
bowled along very fast.&nbsp; Where it was ahead, owing to a bend
in the river, there was no room to tack, and one of us would jump
ashore with a line, and tow.&nbsp; The Ant is just like a canal,
except that it has no tow-path.&nbsp; The fishing in it is
remarkably good, particularly at Irstead shoals, where there is a
stretch of water about half a mile long, with an even depth of
four to five feet, and a firm, level, pebbly bottom, a curiosity
in this land of boggy streams.&nbsp; This is an excellent spot
for perch and pike.&nbsp; It is marked by the presence of a
church on the western bank, and is one of the few places on these
waters where a person who cannot swim can bathe with safety or
comfort.&nbsp; The muddy bottom, of course, prohibits
wading.&nbsp; As you approach the entrance to Barton Broad, the
bottom becomes muddy again, and the Broad itself is full of mud;
there being large &ldquo;hills&rdquo; where the water is not more
than two feet deep.&nbsp; The navigable channels wind between
these hills, and are marked out by posts.&nbsp; The Broad is a
mile long, and very pretty, <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and the entrance to it is four and a
half miles from the mouth of the Ant.&nbsp; In our light-draught
lateener, we ignored the channels, and sped about all over,
often, however, finding our speed diminished, as the keel cut
through the soft mud, and turned up yellow volumes of mud
behind.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that in some Broads and
portions of Broads, the mud is of a light yellow colour, and in
other portions black.&nbsp; As all this mud is the result of
decayed vegetation, this difference is singular.</p>
<p>There is an artificial island in the Broad, where a picnic
party were then enjoying themselves.&nbsp; We sailed away into
the long bight which leads towards Neatishead, where the bowery
woods, fringing the water, spoke of welcome shade, but we were
brought to a stop by the mud, and had some difficulty in getting
back.&nbsp; On this very lovely Broad, we found we had much
better stick to the channels, which were wide enough, and explore
the shallows in the jolly.&nbsp; The fishing here is remarkably
good.&nbsp; I do not think any objection is made to angling for
coarse fish, but permission must be obtained for pike
fishing.&nbsp; The Broad, though the water is fresh, is affected
by the rise and fall of the tide.&nbsp; Going on one night in the
dark, I missed the channel, and ran so hard on to a
&ldquo;hill,&rdquo; that in the morning when the tide was at its
height, we had to lay the yacht on her side by means of lines and
tackles to the nearest channel posts ere we could float her
off.&nbsp; The Broad is easy of access, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>by going to
Stalham railway station, and hiring boats at Stalham, whence a
row of about two miles will bring you on to the Broad.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At the north end of the Broad, a wide dyke leads
northwards.&nbsp; This divides into two about a mile from the
Broad; the left-hand one leads to Dilham and North Walsham,
becoming a canal, with locks and water-mills.&nbsp; We took the
right-hand one, and on coming to another sub-division, took the
left-hand one, the right leading to a grown-up piece of water,
known as Sutton Broad.&nbsp; The course we chose led us over
Stalham Broad, which, though marked on maps as a piece of open
water, now only consists of a tract of marsh, with a dyke kept
open through it.&nbsp; Stalham is at the end of this dyke.&nbsp;
Here there are two good inns, the &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Maid&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and there are plenty of good
boats for hire at the waterside.&nbsp; Stalham has a station on
the Yarmouth and North Norfolk Railway, and as a fishing station
is considered very good.</p>
<p>We caught a pike in the dyke, at luncheon time (ours as well
as his), and a big fellow of about fourteen pounds in weight was
said to haunt the spot.&nbsp; We saw a large fish strike at some
roach, but he would not look at our spinning-bait.&nbsp; Within
sight of the dyke end is a tumble-down house, with a thatched
roof, broken-backed, and altogether so jumbled and
ancient-looking, that it makes a capital subject for a
sketch.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we sailed quietly back to the cutter, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>and took both
boats back to the Bure, and down it to St. Benet&rsquo;s Abbey,
which we reached by moonlight.</p>

</a>Wynne had taken a great fancy to the lateener, which had been
lent to me by a friend, and as we wished to explore the Broads
about Hickling, all too shallow for the cutter, we decided to
take both yachts up the Thurne to Heigham Bridges, and leave the
cutter there, while we took the lateener up on the wide, wild
waters above the bridge.&nbsp; The next morning we devoted to
pike fishing, at the mouth of the Thurne, getting our bait with a
casting-net.&nbsp; We got up very early, and were moored in a
convenient spot, and all rigged up ready to start before the mist
had risen off the water.&nbsp; I do not intend to go into the
details of our sport, which was not out of the way, but by one
o&rsquo;clock we got six pike, from four to ten pounds in weight,
and put back four under-sized fish.&nbsp; This was with live
bait, without moving more than one hundred yards from the same
spot.</p>

</a>Being tired of fishing, we had a swim, and then dinner; and,
late in the afternoon, we hoisted sail, to a stiff breeze, Wynne
and the man in the cutter, and I in the lateener.&nbsp; They ran
away from me so quickly, however, that I could not stop them at
the entrance to Womack <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a> Broad, as I had
intended, and was obliged to go in chase of them up to Heigham
Bridges.&nbsp; The round, bluff bows of my old lateener, designed
to support the heavy mast, which raked forward over them, made
such a hollow in the water, and raised such a big wave, that
sailing very fast was impossible.&nbsp; As it was, the nose of
the boat sank so that it seemed as if she must run under, a fate
not uncommon with lateeners, when running before a stiff
breeze.&nbsp; It was this peculiarity of theirs, combined with
the large foreyard, more than twice the length of the boat <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>which caused
the rig to fall into disuse.&nbsp; For turning to windward,
however, they are uncommonly handy, and easily managed
single-handed.&nbsp; The Thurne is a fairly wide stream, with
deep water, so that you can tack close up to the banks.&nbsp; It
is four miles from the mouth of the Thurne to Heigham Bridges,
and the cutter was there ten minutes before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Wynne, I wanted you to stop at that dyke, half
way up, but I could not make you hear me.&nbsp; There is a
charming little Broad there, called Womack Broad, and a picture
ready composed, so bring your paint-box, and we will beat back in
the lateen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the dyke in half an hour, tacking in that narrow
channel with great celerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boat turns more quickly than the cutter, I think;
at all events, there is less trouble in managing <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>her,&rdquo;
said Wynne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know that I think a fine-bowed
lugger, with main and mizen rig, would be a handy boat for these
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the old lateeners have been turned into
luggers, and sail very well.&nbsp; Here is the dyke, nearly a
mile long, and fringed with ferns and flowers, reeds and
bulrushes, iris and forget-me-nots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes a wherry.&nbsp; What shall we do?&nbsp;
There is no room to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go to windward of her, or her sail will take
the mast out of us.&nbsp; Here is a place made wide to admit of
wherries passing, and we can hold on here until she gets
by.&nbsp; There, that was a tight fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat sailor must be very careful to keep to windward of
the wherries in narrow waters, as their huge gaffs and sails take
up a great deal of room, and if they catch your mast, they may
carry it away, or capsize you.&nbsp; It is still more important
not to get across the bows of a wherry, as she would get the best
of the encounter, and a small yacht very much the worst of
it.&nbsp; It is not often that accidents happen through any
collision, but occasionally the crew of a row-boat get bewildered
and row across the bows of a wherry, sailing fast, and a day of
pleasure is turned into mourning.&nbsp; A special Providence
seems to watch over amateur boat-sailors, and it is marvellous to
see how they come unharmed out of predicaments which seem most
serious.&nbsp; The wherries are sailed remarkably well, and you
can generally rely <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>on their carefulness, so that you may sail your yacht
rigidly according to the rule of the road.&nbsp; One thing should
be remembered, the wherry&rsquo;s sailing is a matter of
business, and the yachtsman&rsquo;s is a matter of pleasure only;
therefore, it is well to give way to a wherry, if there is any
doubt on the point, and not hamper her unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The dyke we were then sailing down is about a mile long,
leading westward to Womack Broad, which was once a nice sheet of
water, but is very rapidly growing up, each year seeing an
accretion to the growth of spongy marsh, and an additional layer
of mud on the bottom.&nbsp; At present, the channel is navigable
for wherries, which ply to Ludham village, at the further end of
it.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side, as we entered the Broad, is a bit of
an old-world picture: a boat-builder&rsquo;s shed, large and old,
and of picturesque construction, stands on the margin, amid low
bushes and under the shade of mighty trees.&nbsp; Beneath it is a
large boat, of an age and type unknown, and a wherry sleepily
awaiting repair.&nbsp; Behind the boat-house is a barn, whose
high-thatched roof is shaded by the branches of a cherry
tree.&nbsp; By the side of the boat-shed is a dyke, where sundry
small craft are ensconced.&nbsp; Behind all, and peeping out of a
garden run wild, are low, thatched cottages, and scattered about,
among the tall grasses, are trunks of trees, curved
&ldquo;knees&rdquo; of oak, suitable for boat-building, and
broken-up boats and punts.&nbsp; On the still water in front is
<a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>moored a
floating eel-fisher&rsquo;s hut, and all around is the sense of
the repose of the past.&nbsp; The former busy life has left its
emblems resting in acquiescence with the fate which contracts the
sphere of their usefulness, day by day, and year by year, as the
vegetation slowly, but surely, drives out the water.&nbsp; That
dense growth of reeds lies upon a skim of soil which would not
bear the weight of a dog, and now undulates with the movement of
the water, but in three years&rsquo; time it may bear the weight
of a man.</p>

</a>An old man who lives near there, grumbles because the artists
come and paint his cottage and broad, and take away pounds&rsquo;
worth of sketches, and never think of sending him a picture in
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>It was a lotos lake to us that afternoon.&nbsp; Wynne painted,
and I fished, and we sailed back to Heigham Bridges by
moonlight.</p>
<p>Womack Broad is not shown upon some maps and charts, but those
who are susceptible to a lovely scene should not pass it by.</p>

</a>Heigham Bridge is a small stone one, with not much room to
get through, and a little above it is the railway bridge, over
which the Eastern and Midlands Railway runs, with a station not
far off&mdash;Potter Heigham.&nbsp; Near the station is the
&ldquo;Falgate&rdquo; Inn, where there is comfortable
accommodation.&nbsp; A gate hangs over the inn by way of a sign,
and on its bars is inscribed the following&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This gate hang high<br />
But hinder none,<br />
Refresh and pay<br />
And travel on,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The omission of the <i>s</i> in the third person singular of
the verb is truly Norfolk, and common even among the middle
classes.&nbsp; At the bridge is the &ldquo;Waterman&rsquo;s
Arms,&rdquo; where one or two bedrooms, and a small parlour, all
scrupulously clean, are obtainable.&nbsp; Just by the bridge, in
a sort of wooden &ldquo;Peggoty&rsquo;s Hut,&rdquo; lives
Applegate, <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>who has good boats, sailing and rowing, for hire, stowed
away in a remarkably neat boat-house.&nbsp; The fishing all round
is as good as it can be, and I never fail to get a jack near the
bridge, while, within four miles lie Hickling and Somerton
Broads, Heigham Sounds, and Horsey Mere.&nbsp; For myself, I
should prefer this as a fishing and boating station, to any
other, because of the wildness of the district.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p98a.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The tide ebbs and flows strongly; and I caught Wynne standing
on the bridge, and looking in a perplexed way at the rate the
perfectly fresh water of the river was running up stream.&nbsp;
The exit of these waters&mdash;at Yarmouth&mdash;was twenty miles
away, by water; Heigham Bridge is only between four and five
miles from the sea, in a direct line, and the water was now
running eastward, towards the sea, and the lakes, which daily
rise and fall, though only a few inches, actuated by the salt
tide, &ldquo;so near, and yet so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, this is a strange country,&rdquo; said Wynne,
&ldquo;and not, I should think, beyond the possibility of a
sudden visit from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, those light-coloured mounds in the distance are the
sea-banks, of sand, only held together by scanty marram
grasses.&nbsp; We will pay them a closer visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got the lateener through the bridges, taking sufficient
things for a night&rsquo;s absence, and sailed away up the
Thurne, which seems now to lose its name as a river, and take
that of the &ldquo;Hundred Stream.&rdquo;&nbsp; About half a <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>mile above
the railway bridge is the mouth of Kendal, or Candler&rsquo;s,
Dyke, a narrow winding stream, up which we turned, soon to find
ourselves bordered by tall reeds on either hand, and then sailing
through a wilderness of water and reeds so tall that they bounded
our view.&nbsp; This is Heigham Sounds, now greatly overgrown,
and a capital place for wild fowl; also for rudd, which here
attain a very large size, and go in immense shoals.&nbsp; Out of
the channel the water is extremely shallow.&nbsp; In the channel,
particularly in Kendal Dyke, I have caught a good number of
pike.</p>
<p>The fishing on all these Broads&mdash;Hickling, Horsey, and
the Sounds&mdash;is nominally preserved, but fair anglers do not
seem to be interfered with.&nbsp; At all events, in the channel
and the dykes one may pretty well do as one likes, and no attempt
has ever been made to set up an exclusive right to the
rivers.&nbsp; I note that a Fishery Preservation Society has been
formed to abolish illegal netting, and to overlook this district,
and under the auspices of this it is probable that riparian
owners will not object to anglers taking a share of the
superabundant fish out of the Broads.&nbsp; I call the fish
superabundant advisedly, and will adhere to the term until
anglers can assure me that they know what to do (usefully) with
the number of fish they catch, and cease from throwing them away
on the bank, after ascertaining their weight and number.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Well, we sailed as close to the wind as we could&mdash;and <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>nothing
goes closer than a lateener&mdash;and could just lie the channel
through another reedy lake, called Whiteslea, on to the vast
expanse of Hickling Broad, a lake 400 acres in extent, and
looking three times as large, owing to the extreme lowness of its
shores, the absence of any landmarks, and the great concave sky,
which seems to fit close down all around it.&nbsp; A channel
across it is marked by posts, which we left to starboard, as we
sailed over it.&nbsp; The width of the channel you will have to
determine by experiment, as there is no guide.&nbsp; At a guess,
it is twenty yards wide, and all the rest of the Broad is so
shallow that you might wade over it, and find a hard, yellow,
gravel bottom almost everywhere.&nbsp; Trusting in our two-feet
draught, we sailed hither and thither, and felt our way checked,
as the keel cut through masses of weed, and then the bound
forward, as the boat entered a part clear of weeds.&nbsp; These
bunches of weed have lately increased greatly in Hickling Broad,
which used to be comparatively free from them, and the
promontories of reeds are pushing themselves further and further
into the lake, and the bays between are getting shallower.&nbsp;
Still, the lake is large enough, as yet, to be able to stand a
little filching from.</p>
<p>We sailed down to Catfield staithe, on the western side of the
Broad, and not far from Catfield railway station, on the line
already alluded to.&nbsp; Then we went to Hickling staithe, at
the north end, where there is an inn, the &ldquo;Pleasure
Boat,&rdquo; and walked into the village to post letters, and to
receive some.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Boats
of a rough kind can be obtained here for fishing purposes.&nbsp;
They are long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, and the usual method of
propulsion is by &ldquo;<i>setting</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The setter
sits in the extreme stern, and pushes the boat along with a light
pole, at a great rate.&nbsp; There are often setting races at
local regattas, and great fun they are.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The number of broken-up lateeners on the shores of the Broad
attest the decay of large pleasure-boat sailing on these remote
waters, but the smaller class of centre-board boats are coming
into favour, and are, perhaps, more suitable.</p>
<p>After lunch we had to reef the great foresail, which was not
an easy operation, as the reef was taken in along the yard, and
we had to go into the jolly boat to get to <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the end of
it.&nbsp; The jolly boat committed a joke its species is very
fond of, under similar circumstances; that is, it slipped away
from under one of us, and left him clinging to the yard, with his
legs in the water.</p>

<p>I shall never forget three days I spent, on Whiteslea and
Heigham Sound, for the fishing and fowling, one December with a
friend.&nbsp; I stayed in the little cottage on the small island
in Whiteslea.&nbsp; We had two boats and two men to attend to us
during the day, but at night we were left to ourselves in the
lonely house, where the water oozed through the floor, and the
beds were so damp that I slept completely clothed in my
oilies.&nbsp; There was a bitter north-easter sweeping over the
dry reeds under a leaden sky, and the sport was of the
slowest.&nbsp; I never felt the cold so much, accustomed though I
am to winter pike-fishing.</p>

</a>It was exhilarating work sailing over Hickling Broad, and we
were very loth to leave its wind-swept waters.&nbsp; We had a
rare run back along the channel, and over Whiteslea, and then
turned sharp to the left, up the Old Meadow dyke leading to
Horsey Mere.&nbsp; This dyke is a mile long, and of fair depth,
but so narrow that people fishing on the banks had to hold up
their rods as we passed, while our sail swept the tops of the
reeds.&nbsp; Then we shot into Horsey Mere, a lake of 130 acres
in extent, with a small island in the middle.&nbsp; It was very
clear, and very shallow, the channel for wherries lying along the
west side of it, into Palling dyke, which leads north-westward
for several miles until it reaches almost to the sea.</p>
<p>The white sand-hills on the coast were plainly visible, and
the thunder of the surf was audible, as the sea was <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>but a mile
and a half away.&nbsp; We did what nearly every one else does who
visits Horsey in a yacht; landed at the east end of it, and
walked to the coast, but it was too rough to bathe.&nbsp; These
sand-hills form a very curious barrier between the salt and fresh
water.&nbsp; They are steep and high, and make one wonder by what
force of wind and waves they attained their present shape and
dimensions, in so flat a country, and why the like forces do not
dissipate them over the plain.&nbsp; Breaches have been made in
them by the sea, from time to time, notably in the winter of
1791, when a very high tide made several gaps, and threatened to
overwhelm the marshes inland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this Mere as well as any of the Broads,&rdquo;
said Wynne, when we returned to the yacht.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so
very still and lonely, and its quiet is in such contrast to the
roar and unrest of the sea close by.&nbsp; Is the fishing free
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is supposed to be preserved, though I
don&rsquo;t suppose anyone will object to our catching a pike for
supper, if you wish.&nbsp; There are no pike like those in
Horsey, the proverb says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the wind had fallen as suddenly as it arose, and the
glamour of a fiery sunset shone over the silent mere.&nbsp; An
occasional cry of coot, or duck, or splash of fish, and the
distant sound of the sea, but emphasized the stillness around
us.&nbsp; We sat on the cabin roof, and talked lazily, as the
dusk came slowly on, and our voices were low, in unison with the
evening hush.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; said Wynne, &ldquo;that
you are so fond of these waters.&nbsp; An evening like this, in
such watery solitude, makes a strong impression upon
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horsey Mere is only accessible by water.&nbsp; There is a
railway station&mdash;Martham&mdash;about four miles off, but if
you walked from there you could get no sight of the Broad without
a boat, and boats are not procurable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these cushions stuffed with?&rdquo; asked
Wynne, as we lay down for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse-hair, I expect; but then age has made them hard
and crabbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that the sleeping accommodation might be
vastly improved in your Norfolk boats generally.&nbsp; Canvas
cots or hammocks, air beds and pillows, would all be better than
the thin cushions there are in the cutter.&nbsp; I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sleep to-night, for I have pins and needles
all over me already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in five minutes he was snoring!&nbsp; One could sleep on a
deal plank, or even on an oak one, after a few days and nights on
the Broads.</p>
<p>We woke very early in the morning, and found that a brisk
breeze had sprung up, and that the lateener had dragged her
moorings and drifted into the reeds.&nbsp; She had taken no harm,
for, short of being run down by a wherry, there are no dangers of
shipwreck on the Broads, and you might drift about unmoored, for
all the hurt there is likely to accrue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p109.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>After a hurried breakfast we hoisted the foresail, and <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>tore down
the dyke into Heigham Sounds, across which we sped fast, throwing
the shallow water into waves, which shook the reeds
mightily.&nbsp; When we emerged from Kendal dyke into the main
stream, we turned to the left, and in less than a mile reached
Martham Ferry, which was stretched across the river while some
wagons were passing across.&nbsp; This ferry is a large raft,
which is kept in a recess on either side of the river, and
floated across, reaching from bank to bank when required.&nbsp;
There is no one to tend it, and if it happens to be on the other
side, a wayfarer must wait until some one appears on the other
side to get it across.&nbsp; It is a wonderfully clumsy thing to
look at, and is not regarded with friendly eyes by the wherrymen,
who run their wherries full tilt against it too often at night,
or when, with the wind astern, they are unable to stop.&nbsp; One
wherryman, exasperated beyond endurance, let his wherry go at it
with all her force when running before half a gale, but only
smashed the bows of his vessel, not moving the ferry a bit or
injuring it, for it is heavily bound with iron to withstand such
experiments.</p>
<p>We sailed to and fro until the wagons had passed, but a wherry
coming up had to lower her sail in a hurry, and then struck the
raft with great force before it could be drawn away.&nbsp; This
jammed it diagonally across the river, and it was half an hour
before it could be moved.</p>
<p>At the other side of the ferry, and at the mouth of a dyke, is
a capital place for pike and large eels, and I <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>can
conceive of no better-looking pike place than the mile of stream
between here and Somerton or Martham Broad.&nbsp; The water is
deep and clear, with a stratum of lily leaves, about four feet
below the surface, and here and there lilies on the
surface.&nbsp; As we sailed over its glassy surface, not ruffled
by the crossing wind, on account of the high reeds and grasses,
we could see thousands of fish of all sizes darting away beneath
us; and at the end of the main dyke, where it divides into two,
is a deep, clear pool, with a hard, gravelly bottom, where there
are any quantity of perch and large roach.&nbsp; It is the
beau-ideal of a spot for bottom-fishing, but &ldquo;fine and far
off&rdquo; must you fish, for the water, though deep, is passing
clear.&nbsp; It is easily accessible from Martham railway
station, and preferably from Potter Heigham, where, too, you
could procure a boat.</p>
<p>The right-hand dyke leads to Somerton Broad, another
reed-surrounded lake, possessing no particular merit.&nbsp; From
Martham ferry we walked up a steep road to the village, lying
around a broad green, and had we time we would have ascended the
tower of the church, which is a conspicuous object for miles, and
from which a splendid view of sea and lake is attainable.</p>
<p>In the church we noted a tablet to one Burraway, whose history
is told there, but is too unpleasant to be more than referred to
here.</p>
<p>After being so long on board a small vessel, one&rsquo;s legs
become cramped and unfit for walking, and the walk to <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Martham and
back, only a couple of miles, quite tired us, and we were glad to
get back to our little craft.&nbsp; In half an hour&rsquo;s time
we were passing under Heigham Bridge, and watching our man
playing a seven-pound pike in the pool below.&nbsp; On the bank,
by the cutter, he had arranged for our inspection a score of
bream, from one pound to three pounds in weight, which he and
another had caught early that morning and the night before.</p>
<p>Before turning our faces again towards Yarmouth, it may be
mentioned that yachts may safely be moored to the bank anywhere
above Acle, care being taken to avoid the obviously shallow
parts.</p>
<p>In many places you will notice the eel-sets, which are fixed
nets across the river for the purpose of intercepting the
silver-bellied eels on their migration to the sea.&nbsp; These
nets are only set at night, and there is a man in charge
(sheltered in a rough sort of house-boat or hut), to lower the
nets when craft are passing, so that they do not obstruct the
navigation.&nbsp; Immense quantities of eels are caught in these
nets, and it has been proved by an inquiry conducted by the Yare
Preservation Society, that other fishes are not caught therein,
and that the sport of the anglers is in no wise interfered
with.</p>

</a>It was two o&rsquo;clock when we hoisted a reefed sail on the
cutter, leaving the lateener in charge of the owner, who had
joined us, and it was three o&rsquo;clock when we reached Acle
bridge, having done the seven miles in the hour, wind and tide
with us.&nbsp; We left Acle at four, being much delayed in
lowering and raising the mast, and reached Yarmouth (12 miles) by
half-past five; so we made a pretty quick passage.&nbsp; We laid
by the &ldquo;Ale Stores&rdquo; for the night, and were very
careful to have the yacht strongly moored, for the tide runs
fast.&nbsp; We were interested in the way the wherries dropped
down out of the North River, with lowered masts, and a chain or
weight out over the bows, so as to retard their speed, as they
drifted stern first, steering, of course, by the pressure of the
faster-flowing tide against the rudder.&nbsp; We had intended to
drop down in a similar way, through the swing bridge just below
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>us, and
to go, by sea, to Lowestoft, a distance of only eight miles; but
as the wind kept getting up, and Breydon was white with foam, we
put off making up our minds until the morning, for the
disproportionate bowsprits and open wells of the river yachts are
not very suitable for sea work.</p>
<p>Of course, we strolled upon the pier, and then returned to the
quay-side by moonlight.&nbsp; We found that it was dead low
water, and that the yacht had receded so much below the level of
the quay, that no plank within reach would touch her.&nbsp; The
man was in the forepeak fast asleep, and it was a long time
before we could wake him, and then we jumped on to some wherries
lying near, and he brought the jolly to us.</p>

</a>We woke at times during the night, and felt the boat swaying,
and heard the wind howling in the rigging to a very pretty
tune.&nbsp; In the morning there was no abatement, and although
it was off the land, we shirked the wetting we should get at sea,
and decided to go over Breydon, and up the Waveney.&nbsp; As the
tide would not make until the middle of the morning, we took the
jolly and rowed down to the harbour mouth at Gorleston.&nbsp; It
is interesting to note how, for three miles, the river flows
parallel with the sea, and, on the average, under half a mile
from it, the dividing land being nothing more substantial than
shingle and sand.&nbsp; Deeply interesting is it, also, to read
of the early struggles of the inhabitants of Yarmouth to maintain
a navigable waterway.&nbsp; <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Sometimes the river would open a new
outlet for itself, and sometimes they made a new one for it; and,
time after time, the river mouth got silted up with the wearing
away of this soft eastern shore.&nbsp; Even now there is often
insufficient water at the bar for deeply-laden vessels of
ordinary size, and the entrance is particularly unsafe for
sailing vessels to enter unassisted at certain times.&nbsp;
Picturesque sights abound on the river, and the quays.&nbsp;
Fishing smacks taking their brown nets on board from carts ranged
alongside; boats of every form and size hauled up on the beach;
vessels building; and vessels in dry docks, undergoing repairs; a
regular covey of smacks, in tow of a powerful steam tug, and
hundreds of similar sights of deep interest to a man bitten with
the joint love of the water and the picturesque.</p>

</a>On reaching the yacht, after rowing back with the first of
the flow, we started with two reefs down to beat over Breydon, on
which the wind against the tide raised a respectable sea.&nbsp;
There was a great deal of weight in the wind, for it was veering
towards the south-west, having been north-west all night, and a
strong south-west wind is generally full of puffs and
squalls.&nbsp; Many times we had the water over the coamings of
the well, and the lee plankways were always awash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something like fun!&rdquo; gasped Wynne, as he
eased off the jib sheet to a squall, and the salt foam dashed in
his face; &ldquo;but there won&rsquo;t be much skin left on my
hands by the time we get to the top of Breydon.&nbsp; These
enormous jibs are horrible things to have to work.&nbsp; If the
yachts had finer bows, they would not want <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>nearly so
much head-sail, and would go as fast, if not faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was heresy to our man, who had seen no other rig for
river boats all his life, and he and Wynne had a heated argument
on the matter, without either being much the wiser.</p>
<p>On reaching the top of Breydon, we turned to the left, up the
Waveney, for half a mile, as far as Burgh Castle, passing over
the dreaded Burgh flats, where a wherry and a yacht were both
hard aground, waiting for the tide to float them off.&nbsp; The
deep water channel is not near the line of posts as one would
imagine, but close along the west shore.&nbsp; We touched two or
three times, but did not stick, and at last moored alongside a
wherry, and landed to inspect the ruins on the top of the
hill.&nbsp; No one passing along these waters should miss the
ruins of Burgh Castle, a Roman station of great interest.</p>
<p>There is a very extensive stretch of massive wall, with towers
at intervals, and at the corners; and we spent a considerable
time in making sketches of the ruins, and admiring the extensive
view.</p>
<p>We could, if we chose, continue on up the Waveney, but the
next five miles of river are narrow, uninteresting, and with a
heavy run of tide, while at the end is a fixed bridge&mdash;St.
Olave&rsquo;s, where the mast would have to be lowered.&nbsp; So
we turned back into the Yare, and sailed up to the mouth of the
new cut at Reedham.&nbsp; This is a ship canal, about three miles
long, connecting the Yare <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>with the Waveney.&nbsp; The tide
flows and ebbs from the Reedham end of it.&nbsp; It is perfectly
straight, and if the wind should be straight up or down it, there
is nothing for it but to tow.&nbsp; Now, however, we had a beam
wind, and tore along merrily enough.&nbsp; But trouble was in
store for us.&nbsp; The canal is wide enough, but it is not kept
&ldquo;didled&rdquo; out (&ldquo;didling,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;dydling,&rdquo; being a Norfolk term for dredging, with
scoops at the end of poles, and lifting the mud on to the banks),
and the sides are very shallow.&nbsp; In the distance, we saw a
large <i>billy-boy</i>, or topsail smack, from the Thames, and as
we approached, it became only too plain from the rake of her
mast, that she was aground in the very middle of the
channel.&nbsp; We got the mainsail down directly, and ran along
under the jib, and then, as we expected, ran aground alongside of
her.&nbsp; A wherry coming behind lowered her sail, and stopped
in time.&nbsp; The smack was laden with rice for Messrs.
Colmans&rsquo; Works, and her skipper, instead of going round by
Yarmouth, had tried the short cut by Lowestoft.&nbsp; After much
shoving and towing we got past, and left the smack patiently
waiting the rise of the tide, or the arrival of a tug.</p>
<p>[Since the foregoing was written, the Cut has been much
improved in depth by dredging, and piling the banks.]</p>
<p>There is very good fishing to be had in the cut, and the banks
are sound and dry, which is a rare thing on these rivers.&nbsp;
There is a lift-bridge at Haddiscoe railway <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>station,
near the end of the cut, which takes some time to get opened;
this is a great inconvenience, and even a serious matter when you
are sailing fast, as there is not room to come about.&nbsp; They
also sometimes fail to open the bridge wide enough, and some time
since a large yacht had her mainsail torn as she passed through,
by its catching on the corner of the uplifted bridge.&nbsp; A
toll of 1s. for each yacht is taken, and a man holds out a bag on
the end of a pole to receive it.&nbsp; The toll for wherries
depends in amount upon whether they have the bridge opened for
them or go through with mast lowered, and at night a chain used
to be put across to prevent them stealing through unobserved, but
the chain was frequently &ldquo;charged&rdquo; at full speed, and
broken.</p>
<p>In a quarter of a mile we emerged into the Waveney, and,
looking back, we could see St. Olave&rsquo;s bridge, a rather
handsome structure.&nbsp; There are a few houses grouped rather
prettily, and a good inn, the &ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; close by the
Bridge, a quarter of a mile from Haddiscoe station, and about a
mile from Fritton Decoy, a favourite lake for fishing, which we
shall afterwards mention.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We then passed through a railway swing bridge, where the East
Suffolk Railway passes over, and sailed without further incident
some two miles further to another swing bridge at Somerleyton,
where the Lowestoft line passes over.&nbsp; This bridge is the
worst on the rivers to pass when wind and tide are against you,
as <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>they
so frequently are, and I am always glad to be well clear of its
piles and projections, through which the tide swirls so
swiftly.</p>
<p>The reach below the bridge used to be the best in the whole
river for pike, but the greater run of tide in recent years and
the salter water has spoiled the pike fishing, for which one has
now to go higher up the river.</p>
<p>There is a very good inn at the top of the bank to the west of
the line, called the &ldquo;Duke&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and a very
beautiful belt of woods skirts the marshes on the east side of
the river, where some delicious &ldquo;bits&rdquo; may be
obtained, and birds, butterflies, and flowers abound.</p>

</a>The angling in all this part of the Waveney is extremely
good, and the bream and roach are of large size.&nbsp; It is not
nearly so much frequented as the other rivers or the upper part
of the Waveney, and is practically unfished, on account of the
difficulty in obtaining boats, there being no boating-station
nearer than Oulton Broad, five miles away.&nbsp; Still, it is
worth while rowing from Oulton Broad, half way to Somerleyton,
for the takes of bream there lately have been wonderful, both as
to size and number.&nbsp; The river is broad and deep, and one
part is as good as another, provided that you select a sufficient
depth of water.</p>
<p>We had no time to fish, and as a matter of fact I cannot stay
to fish, if there is a good breeze blowing; sailing first,
fishing after!</p>
<p>We lay to at the mouth of Oulton dyke, to get our <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>lunch,
which we had put off rather too long.&nbsp; The dyke is nearly as
broad as the river, and a mile and a half long, leading to Oulton
Broad, which we intended to visit, after going up the Waveney to
Beccles.&nbsp; At the junction of the dyke with the river there
is an excellent fishing spot, with a great depth of water.&nbsp;
While we lay there, a large two-masted vessel, a brigantine of
100 tons, came along the dyke at a good pace, with topsails only
set, and looked as if she were going to scoop all the water out
of the river with her great bluff bows.&nbsp; Her crew were
pointing out to us, as we lay on the Waveney, and presently the
hail came across the narrow neck of marsh, &ldquo;Do we turn up
past you to go to Beccles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sharp to port; right around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The topsails came down, and the mainsail went up with great
celerity, and with the aid of her aft canvas, and the helm hard
over, she came round the acute angle of the sharp bend with
creditable quickness, looking a veritable Goliath on those
comparatively narrow waters.&nbsp; As she was now head to wind,
down came her canvas, and half-a-dozen men went ashore with a
long line to tow, and tow they did all the way to Beccles, 13
miles, by which time they must have had enough of it.&nbsp; She
was in sight all day over the marsh.</p>
<p>After lunch, we sailed up the Waveney, having to tack a good
portion of the way; but the river is so tortuous that some of the
reaches can be sailed whichever way the wind is, without
tacking.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;How remarkably clear the water is!&rdquo;
remarked Wynne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those weeds you see are 14 feet at least below us,
and the river is deep close up to the banks.&nbsp; It is a very
pleasant river to sail upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a lot of small fish there are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; The Waveney ought to be the best
bottom-fishing river in England, it is so deep, clear, and sweet,
but the poachers used to harry it dreadfully, with their long,
small-meshed nets, and it was even <i>trawled</i> up by smacks,
to get bait for sea-fishing, but the Norfolk and Suffolk
Fisheries Act has stopped all that, or nearly all, and the river
is rapidly recovering itself.&nbsp; There are some very large
perch in it, and wherever you see the bank gravelly and free from
reeds, the bottom will be hard too, and a haunt of perch.&nbsp;
Look at those bulrushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What huge ones, and what a quantity of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the marshmen sometimes dry the heads, and rub them
up to stuff pillows and cushions with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the north bank is the church of Burgh St. Peter, the tower
of which is built in gradually-lessening steps, and presents a
very strange, un-English appearance.</p>
<p>The sail up to Beccles is a very pleasant one, and pretty bits
continually present themselves.&nbsp; Two miles below Beccles
there is a swing railway bridge, which is tolerably easy to get
through, as there is not a great rush of tide through it, as
under the bridges lower down.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Beccles church had been a prominent object all the way,
and when we arrived at Sayer&rsquo;s Grove, so prettily sylvan a
place that we decided to stay there the night, we went in the
useful jolly another mile to Beccles bridge, 23 miles from
Yarmouth, until lately a narrow arched stone structure, but now
replaced by a wider and more convenient bridge.&nbsp; Passing
through, we skirted the town of Beccles, until we came below the
church, a sight no one should miss who is in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Viewed from the river, it stands on the brow
of a hill, in a commanding position.&nbsp; Landing, we climbed up
a series of steps and reached the churchyard, whence a splendid
view westward is obtained, the river winding in and out through
the green marshes towards Bungay.&nbsp; The south doorway of the
church is richly ornamented, but the peculiar feature of the
church is that the tower, a very high and massive structure, is
separate from it.</p>
<p>Beccles is a quiet, old-fashioned place, with good railway
accommodation, as a glance at the map will show.&nbsp; It is a
cheap place to live in, as there are no heavy rates, these being
defrayed by the letting of valuable marshes belonging to the
town.&nbsp; It is a healthy little place, and pretty withal, and
would, I think, be a capital place for retired persons with small
incomes to settle in.</p>
<p>The river is navigable for wherries and small yachts, for
about ten miles further up to Bungay, but the navigation is
rather troublesome, and there are two or three locks to be passed
through.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>It is
worth while to row up the river a few miles to Shipmeadow
lock.&nbsp; The river all the way is very pretty, with crystal
clear water, and the lock itself is quaint and old-fashioned.</p>

</a>In the night we were awakened by the sound of very heavy rain
pattering on the deck and cabin roof, and presently we discovered
that the recent very dry weather had opened the seams of the
wood, and sundry persistent droppings evaded our attempts to
escape them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nose is wearing away with one dreadful
drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then open your mouth and catch it.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drop went splash into my eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made merry for a time, but presently it clearly became a
case of &ldquo;a drop too much,&rdquo; and we sat up in
despair.&nbsp; Just as things were getting uncomfortably wet, the
storm passed off, and the morning dawned with a wondrous
clearness and brilliance, while the air was full of the sweet,
earthy scents that arise after rain.&nbsp; <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>The reeds
were fresher and greener, and the grasses and flowers glittered
in the sun, like the radiant ripples on the water.&nbsp; And so,
amid the songs of birds and the quickened joy of nature, we
bowled along down the Waveney at a merry pace, and in two hours
we had reached the mouth of Oulton Dyke, the sharp turn into
which necessitated a heavy gibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p131.jpg">
<img alt=
"Oulton Broad"
title=
"Oulton Broad"
src="images/p131.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A mile and a half of this and Oulton Broad opened out before
us.&nbsp; This is the most civilized of all the Broads, and is
always gay with yachts sailing about, and populous with yachts
lying at their moorings.&nbsp; It is of an irregular shape, and
in the bight, or &ldquo;ham,&rdquo; at the north-east end of it,
the yachts are thickly clustered.&nbsp; Also, for what reason it
is hard to say, many of the old and worn-out fishing smacks of
Lowestoft are brought into this corner, and moored against the
bank, where very many of them have sunk, and all are picturesque
in the extreme.&nbsp; Some large sea yachts also use this bight
as a laying-up place for the winter.&nbsp; The river yachts and
sailing boats are of every size and rig, and a paddle in and out
among them is of interest to a nautical mind.&nbsp; At the lower
end of the lake is a lock which gives access for sea-going
vessels to Lake Lothing, which is a tidal lake, two miles long,
ending in Lowestoft harbour and the sea.&nbsp; By the lock is one
of the most charming hostelries it is possible to conceive.&nbsp;
It ought to be called the &ldquo;Angler&rsquo;s Rest,&rdquo; were
it not already called the &ldquo;Wherry Hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
there is capital <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>accommodation for anglers, and boats, bait, etc., are
provided at reasonable rates.&nbsp; There is also another
comfortable inn, called the &ldquo;Commodore,&rdquo; and there
are two smaller inns, the &ldquo;Waveney Hotel&rdquo;&mdash;the
landlord of which, George Smith, is an excellent
waterman&mdash;and the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
railway station is close by, and is now called Oulton Broad
Station, but was formerly Mutford, that being the name of the
village at the east end of the Broad.&nbsp; The village is very
prettily situated between the two lakes, and is only two miles
from the sea.&nbsp; There are lodgings to be had there, and for a
place combining the attractions of lake, river, and sea, it has
few equals.&nbsp; Of course, the Broad is within easy reach of
Lowestoft, the most attractive watering-place on the coast of
Norfolk and Suffolk.&nbsp; It has a fine pier, good houses,
cliffs, a capital harbour for yachts, a harbour for fishing
vessels, where the artist will find much that is picturesque, and
an old part of the town on the higher ground to the north, which
has many features of interest.&nbsp; It has not the noise and
bustle of Yarmouth, but it is gay enough for reasonable
people.</p>
<p>At Lowestoft, facing the harbour, is the club house of the
Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club, and annual visitors to Lowestoft
would find it an advantage to join the Yacht Club for the sake of
the conveniences afforded by the club-house.</p>
<p>Oulton Broad has plenty of fish in it, and the fishing <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>is
free.&nbsp; When the rivers are flooded, and the rank water off
the marshes pours into the river, the fish of all kinds crowd
into the purer waters of the Broad in surprising numbers.&nbsp;
Formerly it was noted for its perch, but for some time they
appear to have decreased in numbers.&nbsp; Lately, however, they
have been more freely caught.&nbsp; In a few more years the
benefits of the Norfolk and Suffolk Fisheries Act will be more
widely felt, as the abundance of small fish in the rivers plainly
testifies.&nbsp; Pike are present sometimes in great quantity,
but the supply seems to fluctuate considerably.&nbsp; For a few
weeks each season they seem to be uncommonly numerous, and large
catches are made.&nbsp; Then they fall off, and none are caught
for some time.</p>
<p>The shooting on the Broad is also free, and in the large room
at the &ldquo;Wherry Inn&rdquo; is a most attractive collection
of fishes and birds, which have met their death in this
locality.</p>
<p>The most interesting and tantalizing inhabitant of the Broad
is the grey mullet, large shoals of which may be seen disporting
themselves on the surface.&nbsp; They run to a large size, and
seem to average two or three pounds in weight.&nbsp; Anglers
cannot catch them as a general rule, but some persons say that
they have succeeded, using small hooks baited with strange baits,
such as the beard of an oyster, or a bit of boiled cabbage
stump.&nbsp; I fancy that by using a fly cast, buoyed at
intervals by bits of cork, and having small hooks baited with
gentles, <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>and then paying out a long line so as to cover a shoal,
some sport might be had.&nbsp; At all events, the experiment is
worth trying some day when there is no wind for sailing.&nbsp;
The mullet, when alarmed by a net or other obstruction, has a
habit of leaping high out of the water, and frequently leaps into
boats.&nbsp; Once, while I was sailing through Reedham Bridge, a
grey mullet, of four pounds in weight, leaped into the jolly-boat
towing astern, and was captured.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p135.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Ruffe"
title=
"Ruffe"
src="images/p135.jpg" />
</a>At Oulton the mullet are often shot with arrows having heavy
lines attached, while they are accidentally confined in the lock
between the Broad and Lake Lothing.</p>
<p>Well, we spent the rest of our holiday at Oulton, and as I was
saying good-bye to Wynne at the station, I asked him what he
thought of the Broads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finest places for boat-sailing and bottom-fishing
in England.&nbsp; I shall bring a boat here in the winter for
wild-fowl shooting on Breydon, and I shall certainly come again
next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ended our cruise.</p>

</a>There are still some very important Broads in Norfolk and
Suffolk, which I could not mention in an account of a cruise,
because they are not accessible from the navigable waters, and,
as a matter of fact, I know comparatively little about them for
that reason.&nbsp; There are the Ormesby, Filby and Rollesby
Broads, lying together in a straggling group four or five miles
north-eastward of Acle.&nbsp; Altogether, they contain 800 acres
of water, but much of this is overgrown by reeds.&nbsp; The Muck
Fleet, which we passed below Acle Bridge, is their outlet into
the river Bure.&nbsp; They are very easily accessible from
Yarmouth by rail to Ormesby station, on the North Norfolk
Railway, and boats may be obtained at the Eel&rsquo;s Foot, and
the Sportsman&rsquo;s Arms, the former having fair staying
accommodation.&nbsp; The fishing is free, at all events to
persons going to the houses named, and <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>uncommonly
good sport is to be had amongst pike, rudd, and bream, the number
of a catch being counted by the hundred, and the weight by the
stone.&nbsp; For fishing, pure and simple, Ormesby Broad is as
good a place as any to visit.</p>

<p>The other lake I have not described is Fritton Decoy, a long
curving lake, about a mile from St. Olave&rsquo;s station, on the
Yarmouth and Lowestoft Railway, and Haddiscoe station, on the
Norwich and Lowestoft Railway.&nbsp; It is only open to anglers
from April to September, being closed the rest of the year, to
protect the wild-fowl decoys, which are still worked on it, by
the two proprietors.&nbsp; For a note upon these decoys, and
others in Norfolk, I must refer the reader to a paper upon
decoys, written by Mr. Thos. Southwell, F.Z.S., published in a
new edition of that most fascinating book, Lubbock&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fauna of Norfolk,&rdquo; issued by the publishers of this
book, and for descriptive accounts to my own larger book,
&ldquo;Norfolk Broads and Rivers,&rdquo; published by Wm.
Blackwood and Sons.</p>
<p>Fritton is an exceedingly beautiful Broad, and its waters are
very deep.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a lake, rather than a Broad
proper.&nbsp; It is extremely well stocked with fish, and good
sport may generally be obtained there.&nbsp; Boats can be
obtained at &ldquo;Fritton Old Hall.&rdquo;</p>

</a>To begin with, it may be well to state that Norwich itself
can be reached from London by two lines of railway&mdash;one via
Colchester and Ipswich, and the other by Cambridge and Ely, the
journey taking from three to four hours.&nbsp; From Norwich,
Yarmouth and Lowestoft may be reached in an hour of slow
travelling, and as the line runs by the river the whole way, and
every station is convenient for fishing purposes, it will be
desirable to give a list of them, with remarks upon the adjacent
fishing places.</p>
<h3>WHITLINGHAM.</h3>
<p>This is too close to Norwich for very good fishing, although
occasionally the fish seem to head up, and good takes are to be
had.&nbsp; Good rowing boats may be obtained at Thorpe Gardens,
five minutes&rsquo; walk from <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>the station.&nbsp; Omnibuses ply
between the Gardens and Norwich every hour.&nbsp; The reach of
the old river is very lovely.</p>
<h3>BRUNDALL</h3>
<p>Is the station for &ldquo;Coldham Hall,&rdquo; at which inn
visitors can be accommodated.&nbsp; The inn is ten minutes&rsquo;
walk from the station down the river, and across the ferry.&nbsp;
There are plenty of boats, and the place is much
frequented.&nbsp; From here down to Buckenham Ferry there are
large numbers of pike, and it is customary to row down trailing a
bait behind.&nbsp; Roach and bream are plentiful.</p>
<h3>BUCKENHAM FERRY.</h3>
<p>From this station you have ten minutes&rsquo; walk down to the
Ferry, where boats are to be obtained, and the fishing generally
is good.</p>
<h3>CANTLEY.</h3>
<p>Close by the station is the &ldquo;Red House&rdquo; Inn, where
there is good accommodation for visitors.&nbsp; Boats can be
had.&nbsp; The fish, as a rule, run larger here than higher
up.&nbsp; The water is deep and the tide swift.&nbsp; When the
water is fairly clear, some good pike may be had.</p>
<h3>REEDHAM.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;Ferry&rdquo; Inn is ten minutes&rsquo; walk.&nbsp;
Good accommodation.&nbsp; The bream run large, so do the perch,
of which there used to be large numbers <i>under the ferry
boat</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>The
line divides at Reedham, one part going to Yarmouth and the other
to Lowestoft.&nbsp; There is no fishing place on the Yarmouth
branch, but on the Lowestoft line there are&mdash;</p>
<h3>HADDISCOE,</h3>
<p>whence the Cut may be fished.&nbsp; Boats are difficult to
obtain, but the landlord of the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; Inn, at St.
Olave&rsquo;s bridge, might procure you one.&nbsp; This is the
station for Fritton Decoy.</p>
<h3>SOMERLEYTON.</h3>
<p>This would be an excellent fishing station if boats could be
procured, but you cannot rely upon being able to borrow
one.&nbsp; The porters at the swing-bridge, or the landlord of
the &ldquo;Duke&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; might direct you where to
obtain a boat.&nbsp; I think the latter has one or two.&nbsp; The
bream are very large and numerous.&nbsp; The good fishing in this
part of the river has been exemplified by Mr. Winch, of Norwich,
who has taken 8 stone in a day&mdash;five bream weighing 20 lbs.,
and one bream weighing 6&frac34; lbs.</p>
<h3>OULTON BROAD.</h3>
<p>See the last chapter for full information as to this important
fishing station.</p>
<p>Another line from Norwich leads to&mdash;</p>
<h3>WROXHAM.</h3>
<p>7 miles.&nbsp; The river is full of roach, bream, perch, and
pike, although it is much fished.&nbsp; Boats at Jimpson&rsquo;s
<a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>or
Whittaker&rsquo;s, where there is also fair accommodation for
visitors.&nbsp; The Broad is a mile and a half down stream, from
the bridge.&nbsp; It can be fished by permission only.&nbsp;
Tickets to fish on the Broad can be obtained through Mr. C. J.
Greene, Fishing Tackle Maker, London Street, Norwich, at 2s. 6d.
per boat.</p>
<h3>COLTISHALL.</h3>
<p>Two miles further.&nbsp; The fishing is much better here than
is generally supposed, but boats are not plentiful.&nbsp; Enquire
at the waterside who is likely to have one at liberty.</p>
<p>The Eastern and Midlands line runs from Yarmouth through the
heart of the Broad District to North Walsham, on the Norwich,
Wroxham, and Cromer line.&nbsp; The stations from Yarmouth
are&mdash;</p>
<h3>ORMESBY.</h3>
<p>A mile and a half from its Broads, about 200 acres of which
are free.&nbsp; The fishing is as good as it can be for pike,
rudd, roach, and bream.&nbsp; Boats at the &ldquo;Eel&rsquo;s
Foot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sportsman&rsquo;s Arms.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Staying accommodation at the former.</p>
<h3>MARTHAM.</h3>
<p>Not far from the river Thurne, but the next station is more
convenient.</p>
<h3>POTTER HEIGHAM.</h3>
<p>Inns, the &ldquo;Falgate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waterman&rsquo;s
Arms,&rdquo; where <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>there is staying accommodation.&nbsp; Good boats at
Applegate&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The river Thurne and the channels
through Heigham Sounds and Hickling swarm with bream, rudd,
perch, roach, pike, and eels.</p>
<h3>CATFIELD.</h3>
<p>The nearest station to Hickling, but not so convenient for
boats.</p>
<h3>STALHAM.</h3>
<p>Barton Broad is within a mile and a half, where the fishing is
excellent.&nbsp; Plenty of boats obtainable at the end of the
dyke.&nbsp; Inns, the &ldquo;Maid&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; both very comfortable.&nbsp; Stalham is a
pretty village.</p>
<p>Thence to North Walsham there is no fishing station of
interest.</p>
<p>On the direct line between Yarmouth and Lowestoft, <span
class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s</span> is the nearest station to
Fritton.</p>
<h3>ACLE</h3>
<p>Is now a station on the new line between Norwich and Yarmouth,
joining the old line at Brundall.</p>
<p>Of places not accessible by rail, the chief is Horning Ferry,
on the Bure, where there is a capital inn to stay at, kept by a
good host and sportsman, Mr. Thompson, who can be relied upon to
make his visitors comfortable.&nbsp; At Horning village, the
&ldquo;New&rdquo; Inn deserves mention, and boats can be procured
there.&nbsp; Horning is about four miles&rsquo; drive from
Wroxham, and ten from Norwich.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>The
reader is requested to look at the Map, and note the relative
position of the various places.&nbsp; As to fishing, it can
hardly be said that one is better than another, for all are so
good.</p>

<p>The Tides, however, vary according to the strength and
direction of the wind and the quantity of flood water in the
river.</p>
<h2>FISHING GENERALLY.</h2>
<p>In the rivers it is customary to fish in 10 to 14 feet of
water, and the shortness of the swims necessitates the line being
heavily weighted, in order that it may sink rapidly.&nbsp; The
floats are necessarily large, particularly when used for the
lower reaches, where there is a considerable tidal current.&nbsp;
The boats are moored in a line with the stream, not across it, as
on the Thames, and the swims are thus very short.&nbsp; For the
upper and clearer waters, the Nottingham system of angling might
be advisable, but in the more turbid lower reaches the Norfolk
style is practically the best.&nbsp; Worms are used for bream,
and paste for roach.&nbsp; Worms are procurable at some of the
tackle shops, but anglers will do well to provide them for
themselves if possible.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Boats
are charged for at the rate of from 1s. to 2s. a-day, but are
rather rough concerns, except at Oulton.</p>
<p>Ground-bait, consisting chiefly of meal and clay, is largely
used, but a place is rarely baited beforehand.&nbsp; As there is
ample choice of stations, always moor so that the wind is at your
back, and you will thus have smooth water in front of you.</p>
<p>Small roach as bait for pike, are procurable at most of the
waterside inns, at 1s. to 1s. 6d. a score, but to get the best
sport obtain fish from other waters, particularly dace and
gudgeon.</p>
<p>Pike are, of course, the chief fish in Norfolk, and are
plentiful everywhere.&nbsp; In the rivers they do not run very
large, a ten-pound fish being considered a good one, but in a few
years&rsquo; time, with the freedom from netting the rivers now
enjoy, we may expect some very large ones to be caught in the
rivers.&nbsp; In private waters there are veritable monsters, but
the stranger is not likely to make acquaintance with them.</p>
<p>Live-baiting and spinning with a spoon, or artificial bait
trailed behind a boat, are the usual modes of fishing for pike in
Norfolk.&nbsp; Trolling with a dead gorge, and spinning with a
dead bait by casting, as in the Thames, are comparatively rarely
practised, although I believe that in some portions of the rivers
these methods would &ldquo;pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have seen
fly-fishing for pike practised with success here, and I firmly
believe that on some of the shallower Broads it would be very
deadly.</p>

are only locally common wherever there is a suitable bottom for
them, as at Irstead Shoals and Hickling, and in some portions of
the Bure and Waveney, but they run to a large size, and are
sometimes caught between three and four pounds in weight.</p>
<p>Bream are most common of all, and may be caught by hundreds
and the stone weight.&nbsp; They run up to five and six pounds in
weight, and a take by two rods in a day of 150, averaging
half-a-pound apiece, is not a rare event.</p>
<p>Roach are very numerous and large, many running close to two
pounds in weight.</p>
<p>Rudd are beautiful game fish, common in some of the Broads,
particularly Ormesby, and give rare sport if you get among a
shoal of them.</p>
<p>Eels are, of course, present in any number, and
&ldquo;babbing&rdquo; for them, with a bunch of worms threaded on
to worsted, is not a bad way of passing a warm night.</p>
<p>Tench are common, but are not often caught with a rod and
line.&nbsp; They are taken in bow nets, and run very large.&nbsp;
In hot weather, in June, they may be taken by the hand as they
bask in the shallow water among the weeds.&nbsp; Some fishermen
are very skilful in this particular mode of catching them.</p>
<p>Carp are caught sometimes, but not often, although there are
plenty of them.</p>
<p>Dace and gudgeon are not so frequently caught in the navigable
waters as other fish.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Chub
and barbel are unknown in the Broad District.</p>
<p>The bream are so excessively abundant that they spoil the
fishing for other fish, notably for perch, and I think it would
be an excellent thing if the different preservation societies
would set apart a few days each year for systematic netting to
thin the bream, replacing the other fish, and selling those
retained.&nbsp; What is the good to anglers of catching thousands
of small bream?&nbsp; Are not a score over a pound weight each
better than ten-score fingerlings?&nbsp; Judicious thinning out,
under proper supervision, would have a most beneficial effect on
the size of the fish generally.</p>
<p>There are several preservation societies, of which the Yare
Preservation Society is the chief.&nbsp; Mr. C. J. Greene, of
London Street, Norwich, Fishing Tackle Maker, is the honorary
secretary.&nbsp; The objects of these societies are to abolish
netting and poaching, and protect the river for fair
angling.&nbsp; The subscriptions are nominal (5s.), and yet they
are supported entirely by local efforts.&nbsp; As a rule, none of
the anglers from London and other distant parts, who come down to
Norfolk and have the best of sport, contribute anything to the
societies which are instrumental in furnishing them with
sport.&nbsp; This is exceedingly shabby of visitors here, and I
trust that those who have been induced to visit the Broads
through my writings will at least make the small return to
Norfolk anglers of assisting them in their efforts to make these
waters the best public fishing places in the kingdom.</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>There
are a few professional fishermen to be hired by the angler.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Professor&rdquo; Day, of Richmond Hill, Norwich, is one of
the best, and knows every inch of water, and there are some good
men at Oulton.</p>
<p>Strangers frequently complain that they cannot meet with the
excellent sport which falls to the lot of the local anglers, and
I remember Mr. Cholmondeley Pennel being immensely dispirited at
his non-success on our waters.&nbsp; I lately interviewed a local
gentleman who is well known as a successful fisherman, and I
append my questions and his remarks thereon, which will afford
some valuable information.</p>
<h3>ROACH.</h3>
<p><i>1.&nbsp; Where found at different periods of the
year</i>?</p>
<p>Throughout the summer the entire length of our local streams
where the water is fresh and not salt or brackish; the finest
fish and greatest number between Cantley and Coldham Hall, on the
Yare; large numbers also in the dyke leading from Oulton
Broad.&nbsp; In winter they appear generally to retire to the
deep waters, and are sometimes found in good quantity about
Thorpe Broad, and may be angled for with success in deep spots on
the Bure and other waters.</p>
<p><i>2.&nbsp; Best periods to fish for them</i>?</p>
<p>July to October, but good catches may often be had in
November, and during the winter and early spring months by any
expert angler who doesn&rsquo;t mind the cold.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span><i>3.&nbsp; What time of day at different
seasons</i>?</p>
<p>As a rule, but few fish are caught during the middle of the
day; this is especially the case in bright warm weather.&nbsp; On
dull, &ldquo;close&rdquo; days, however, they will often bite
freely throughout the day.&nbsp; The morning up to about 11.30,
and from 3 to 6 or 7 p.m. are undoubtedly the best times to fish
during summer, and in winter almost any time up to sunset.</p>
<p><i>4.&nbsp; What depth of water</i>?</p>
<p>As a rule, the best fish are found during summer in the
deepest water, and should not be angled for on the Yare at a less
depth than nine or ten feet.&nbsp; On the Bure the deepest spots
that can be found.&nbsp; In March or April shallower waters
should be tried.</p>
<p><i>5.&nbsp; How affected by the tide</i>?</p>
<p>Variously.&nbsp; Sometimes an angler gets all his fish on the
up tide, and at other times on the ebb.&nbsp; I, however, suspect
that certain local formations of the river bed, have much to do
with this.</p>
<p><i>6.&nbsp; What ground-bait</i>?</p>
<p>The best I have ever used is composed of bran, bread, and
boiled wheat, in fair proportions, made up into firm balls about
the size of an orange.&nbsp; One of these thrown in occasionally,
and now and then a few grains of boiled wheat will generally
suffice to keep a good quantity of fish about your boat.</p>
<p><i>7.&nbsp; Are places ever baited beforehand</i>?</p>
<p>Not often for roach.&nbsp; Believe this is done occasionally
by some, but have never practised it myself.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span><i>8.&nbsp; What baits are most successful</i>?</p>
<p>During summer the most successful baits are well-boiled wheat
and paste, red or white, in such clear waters as the Waveney and
the upper reaches of Bure, etc.&nbsp; White paste is best on the
Yare, the red always kills the best fish.&nbsp; In autumn,
gentles, and later on brandlings and gentles, or better still,
small red worms, &ldquo;blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many other
baits used with good success occasionally, but these are by far
the most reliable.</p>
<p><i>9.&nbsp; What kind of rod</i>?</p>
<p>For tight-line fishing in the deep waters of the Yare, the rod
should be light, stiff, and from 15 to 18 feet in length.&nbsp;
For running tackle a shorter rod will do, and for this I prefer
one of hickory.&nbsp; Should recommend cane for the longer
kind.</p>
<p><i>10.&nbsp; Number of hook</i>?</p>
<p>When the fish are of fair size, I use No. 9, at other times
Nos. 10 or 12.&nbsp; Those known amongst anglers as
&ldquo;Crystal,&rdquo; are excellent for roach fishing.</p>
<p><i>11.&nbsp; Is running tackle advisable</i>?</p>
<p>Running tackle is decidedly preferable for such deep, strong
waters as those between Coldham Hall and Reedham.&nbsp; For the
slower waters of the Bure and the upper reaches of the Yare, I do
not consider that running tackle has any advantages worth
naming.</p>
<p><i>12.&nbsp; Do you use gut or hair, and what kind of
line</i>?</p>
<p>For deep-water fishing I always attach nine feet of <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>gut to my
line; six feet moderately stout and three feet fine drawn.&nbsp;
Line, a fine <i>braided</i> silk.&nbsp; A light, well-shotted
line of this kind has many advantages, especially on a windy
day.</p>
<p><i>13.&nbsp; What kind of float</i>?</p>
<p>Quill at all times.&nbsp; For deep swift waters, a large
pelican or swan quill, for slower and shallower waters a much
smaller one.</p>
<p><i>14.&nbsp; Is line heavily shotted</i>?</p>
<p>For deep waters I use a float carrying upwards of 20
medium-sized shot.&nbsp; These are placed on a space of about a
foot, the bottom one not nearer than about three feet from the
hook, with just one shot on the gut attached to hook.&nbsp; This
arrangement ensures the bait being carried swiftly to the bottom
and kept steady, very important items in roach fishing.</p>
<p><i>15.&nbsp; Is float best attached by lower end only</i>?</p>
<p>Yes, this plan which has been in practice with the
&ldquo;Norwich School&rdquo; for many years past is decidedly the
best, and admits of much more neatness and accuracy in striking a
fish than when the float is attached by upper end as well as
lower.</p>
<p><i>16.&nbsp; Do you strike at first dip</i>?</p>
<p>When good fish are on the feed, the float is first affected by
a slight tremulous movement, and almost immediately settles down,
generally in a slanting direction; the moment to strike is just
as the settling down <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>commences.&nbsp; This, however,
requires a large amount of practice and some keen observation
before an angler becomes expert.&nbsp; Sudden perky bites
indicate small fish, and these are often the most difficult to
catch.</p>
<p><i>17.&nbsp; Are the fish much affected by change of wind,
rain, thick water, etc., and is there any rule on this
head</i>?</p>
<p>Have always found a S.W. to N.W. wind the most favourable,
especially when the water is &ldquo;grey&rdquo; or thick, and
have had capital sport with a moderate east wind, but never when
it has blown strongly from that quarter, and the old maxim</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the wind blows from the east<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fish bite the least,<br />
When the wind&rsquo;s from the west<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fish bite the best,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>contains a great truth in small compass.&nbsp; Fish may
undoubtedly be taken in clear water and in good quantity, but
running tackle and fine, and extreme caution are necessary.</p>
<p><i>18.&nbsp; Do you find that movement in the boat, noise, or
loud talking frightens the fish</i>?</p>
<p>Loud talking or laughter in the boat does not appear to
intimidate the fish, but knocking or any disturbance which
communicates a vibration to the water is decidedly objectionable,
especially in shallower streams, and often causes a great
interruption to the fishing.&nbsp; Have found a pair of
lawn-tennis shoes or slippers very good to wear in a boat when
fishing, for this reason.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span><i>19.&nbsp; Name some of the best catches you have
made or know of</i>.</p>
<p>I do not chronicle my catches, so can give no dates; but have
had some fine catches within the past five or six years,
principally on the Yare.&nbsp; On one occasion, at Buckenham,
with a friend, six stone <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a> between 2.30 and 7
p.m.; another time upwards of five stone in about the same space
of time, and numerous catches of from two to four stone in an
afternoon&rsquo;s fishing; also more than a bushel by measure one
afternoon with a friend fishing in the dyke leading to Oulton
Broad.&nbsp; This was in the first week of September, 1879.</p>
<p><i>20.&nbsp; What is the reason of the non-success of strange
anglers which is so noticeable</i>?</p>
<p>Ignorance of the general requirements of tackle suitable for
fishing in our waters, and also of the <i>modus operandi</i>, one
of the chief reasons being a want of knowledge of the right depth
at which to fish, which could easily be known by simply
&ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; the depth.&nbsp; By way of instance, I
have on several occasions found strangers fishing on the Yare in
12 or 14 feet of water, with their baits only about four or five
feet below the surface, and at the same time wondering that
anglers close by should be catching plenty of fish when they
could get none.&nbsp; Baits, too, are doubtless used which,
although very good for some streams or waters, are of very little
use with us.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>N.B.&mdash;&ldquo;When the wind blows strong and the
waves roll high,&rdquo; it is often very difficult to fish or
even to detect a bite.&nbsp; This is very tantalising, and not
infrequently happens through a shift in the wind when you are in
a capital &ldquo;swim.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remedy for this is to put
on a nice light ledger, with about three hooks, and with which
excellent sport may sometimes be had when it would be impossible
to fish in any other way.</p>
<p>In float fishing for roach, the bait should be just touching
the bottom.&nbsp; A good plan adopted by some is to fish with two
hooks, the bottom one dragging on the bottom, and the upper one
about three or four inches clear of the bottom.&nbsp; This is an
advantage in fast streams, as it retards the onward motion of the
float, the bait is more easily taken, and the swims are not
passed so rapidly.</p>
<h3>BREAM.</h3>
<p><i>1.&nbsp; Where found at different periods of the
year</i>?</p>
<p>During summer, on the Yare, principally between Langley Dyke
and Reedham; in winter often found in good quantity in the
vicinity of Thorpe Broad and about Carrow and Trowse Hythe.&nbsp;
On the Bure they appear to congregate in the deep waters of the
Broads in winter, and make their appearance about the end of May
and through the summer on the river.</p>
<p><i>2.&nbsp; Best periods to fish for them</i>?</p>
<p>July and August.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span><i>3.&nbsp; What time of day at different
seasons</i>?</p>
<p>Good catches of bream are often had in early morning.&nbsp; I
have, on the other hand, had capital sport by moonlight.</p>
<p>For further notes, see answer to same question on
&ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>4.&nbsp; What depth of water</i>?</p>
<p>The deepest waters and quietest eddies are, as a rule, the
best; but I have caught large quantities of fine bream at
Wroxham, on the Bure, in not more than four feet and a half of
water.</p>
<p><i>5.&nbsp; How affected by the tide</i>?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most fish are taken from about half an
hour before high water to half an hour after.&nbsp; For further
notes, see &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>6.&nbsp; What ground-bait</i>?</p>
<p>Boiled maize, boiled barley grains, barley meal made up into
balls, chopped worms, boiled rice.&nbsp; This latter and grains I
have found very killing on the Bure.</p>
<p><i>7.&nbsp; Are places ever baited beforehand</i>?</p>
<p>Mostly overnight, where there is a fair opportunity of doing
so.&nbsp; This mode is very telling on Broads and other still
waters.</p>
<p><i>8.&nbsp; What baits are most successful</i>?</p>
<p>For large fish at Cantley, Reedham, Somerleyton, and other
deep swift waters, ledger fishing, with the tail end of a lobworm
on the hook, is a capital bait.&nbsp; Generally speaking,
however, I have found &ldquo;brandlings&rdquo; the most <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>killing,
and have found a brandling with a gentle placed on the point of
the hook will sometimes be taken readily when no other bait would
be touched.&nbsp; Red paste is often very killing on the
Bure.</p>
<p><i>9.&nbsp; What kind of rod</i>?</p>
<p>Strong and stiff cane or hickory, 15 to 18 feet long, with a
good stout top joint, on the Yare.&nbsp; Shorter will do on the
Bure.</p>
<p><i>10.&nbsp; Number of hook</i>?</p>
<p>The finest catch I ever had was with No. 12 hooks.&nbsp; This
was, however, in comparatively shallow water.&nbsp; Should say
that No. 7 or 8 would be very good sizes for bream fishing
generally.</p>
<p><i>11.&nbsp; Is running tackle advisable</i>?</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>12.&nbsp; Do you use gut or hair, and what kind of
line</i>?</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>13.&nbsp; What kind of float</i>?</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>14.&nbsp; Is line heavily shotted</i>?</p>
<p>In a similar way to that recommended for roach, but having the
bulk of shot placed nearer the hook, it being necessary that the
bait should &ldquo;drag&rdquo; the bottom.</p>
<p><i>15.&nbsp; Is float best attached by lower end only</i>?</p>
<p>As the bream bites more slowly and certain than the roach,
this is quite immaterial.&nbsp; I prefer float attached top and
bottom.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span><i>16.&nbsp; Do you strike at first dip</i>?</p>
<p>A bream bite affects the float with a slight bobbing motion
for a few seconds, he then runs off with it, and slides it down
slantingly; strike as he runs off with the bait or the float is
about to disappear, and you are sure of him.</p>
<p><i>17</i>.&nbsp; <i>Are the fish much affected by change of
wind, rain, thick water, etc., and is there any rule on this
head</i>?</p>
<p>Bream are rarely taken in any quantity when the waters are
very clear.&nbsp; See &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>18</i>.&nbsp; <i>Is legering successfully practised for
large bream, and what is the best modus operandi</i>?</p>
<p>In such rapid waters as those at Reedham, Somerleyton,
etc.&mdash;no other mode of fishing for bream can be practised
with any success worth naming&mdash;ledgers for attaching to line
may be purchased at any tackle shop at 1s. each, and the <i>modus
operandi</i> is very simple, and by no means scientific.&nbsp;
The rod requires to be very strong and of fair length, and three
or four rods may be used from one boat at the same time.</p>
<p><i>19.&nbsp; Do you find that movement in the boat, noise, or
loud talking frightens the fish?</i></p>
<p>Bream are very sensitive to noise, especially knocking in the
boat, which invariably sends them off for an indefinite period,
and should therefore be most carefully avoided.</p>
<p><i>20.&nbsp; Name some of the best catches you have made or
known of</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>About
ten years ago, had, in company with a friend, a catch of 17 stone
in one day on Wroxham Broad, and with only one rod each.&nbsp;
Have heard of many catches from time to time of from 4 to 10 or
12 stone, but am unable now to give names or dates.</p>
<p><i>21.&nbsp; What is the reason of the non-success of strange
anglers which is so noticeable</i>?</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Roach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N.B.&nbsp; In fishing for bream, the bait should always drag
on the bottom.</p>
<h2>YACHTING.</h2>
<p>It will have been gathered from the foregoing pages that the
Rivers and Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk present exceptional
facilities for small-boat sailing and smooth-water yachting,
better, perhaps, than any other part of England.&nbsp; There are
two yachting clubs, the Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club and the
Yare Sailing Club, the latter a very flourishing institution,
furnishing four or five regattas in the year for small 4-ton
yachts and open boats.</p>
<p>There are numbers of suitable yachts for hire, but, owing to
the frequent changes of ownership, it is not practicable to give
a list of those who have boats for hire, which would be of any
use.&nbsp; Enquiry at the inns at Oulton, and advertisements in
the Yarmouth and <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Norwich papers will generally elicit suitable
answers.&nbsp; Bullen, of Oulton, is a likely man to have a yacht
to let.&nbsp; Open sailing-boats with awnings to sleep under, and
small cabin yachts of four to ten tons, can be obtained of
Loynes, Wroxham; and comfortable craft they are.&nbsp; The
awnings of the small boats are waterproof, and most ingeniously
constructed, and the boats can be rowed or sailed anywhere.&nbsp;
Loynes may be trusted to provide everything that is necessary for
comfort, and his yachts and boats are largely patronized.&nbsp;
They are all rigged Una fashion, with one sail, and are very
easily managed.&nbsp; Canoes and rowing boats are in plenty at
the riverside, at Norwich, Yarmouth, and Oulton.</p>
<p>As before stated, the goods traffic on the river is carried on
by means of sailing craft of from 20 to 70 tons burthen, called
wherries.&nbsp; These are long, shallow, graceful vessels, with
an enormous mast, supporting one enormous sail.&nbsp; The sail is
spread by a long gaff, but there is no boom.&nbsp; There is only
one halyard, and the sail is hoisted by means of a winch at the
foot of the mast.&nbsp; There is no rigging to the mast except
the forestay, which is mainly of use for lowering the mast, the
latter being balanced on the tabernacle by a ton and a half of
lead on its heel, so that it is raised as easily as it is
lowered.&nbsp; These wherries sail very fast, very close to the
wind, and are often managed by one man.&nbsp; Yachts built on the
wherry plan are very comfortable craft, and easily managed.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Wherries are frequently hired by private parties, the
hatches are raised a plank or two higher to give greater
head-room, the clean-swept hold is divided into several rooms,
and a capital floating house is extemporized.</p>
<p>There is now quite a fleet of permanently-fitted pleasure
wherries on the rivers, which have ample accommodation for a
party or family, and are to be hired at from 8 to 15 guineas a
week.</p>
<p>A good way of seeing the rivers, if you have no boat, is to
give a wherryman a small sum to take you with him when he makes a
passage.&nbsp; There are always numbers of wherries leaving
Norwich and Yarmouth, and if you hail the one you fancy, you will
be readily taken on board.&nbsp; Thus you might sail from Norwich
to Yarmouth one day, up to Wroxham the next, back to Yarmouth and
up to Beccles, at an expenditure of half-a-crown a day and
refreshments.&nbsp; I am sure that visitors to either Yarmouth or
Lowestoft will do well to avail themselves of this
suggestion.</p>
<p>The navigation is controlled by Acts of Parliament, but
pleasure yachts are exempt from tolls, except, of course, at
locks and Haddiscoe lift bridge.</p>
<p>The rule of the road is very strictly adhered to by the
wherries and local yachts, and necessarily so; but it is a point
of honour not to harass business wherries if it can be avoided,
as these are sailed for a livelihood, while yachtsmen sail for
pleasure.&nbsp; Therefore, if there is a doubt, give the wherry
the benefit of it.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>It is
also a point of prudence not to cross a wherry&rsquo;s bows too
closely, as they would soon smash up a yacht.&nbsp; If you are
civil to a wherryman he will be most civil to you, and
don&rsquo;t slang him if he doesn&rsquo;t at once give way for
you to pass him.</p>
<p>The following racing regulations of the Yacht Clubs simply
epitomise the custom and practice on the rivers, and must be
adhered to:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if two yachts be standing for the shore of any
river or broad, and the yacht to leeward be likely to run aground
or foul any bottom or bank, or not be able to stay without the
windward yacht running foul of her, the windward yacht must be
put about upon being hailed by the member of the Club who may be
in charge of the leeward yacht; the yacht to leeward must also go
about at the same time as the yacht she hails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That in sailing to windward the yacht on the port tack
must give way to the yacht on the starboard tack, and in case of
collision, the owner of the vessel on the port tack shall be
liable to pay all damages that may occur, and forfeit all claim
to the prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That any yacht bearing away or altering her course to
windward or leeward, provided there is no obstruction to prevent
her keeping her course, thereby compelling another vessel to go
out of her course, shall forfeit all claim to the prize.&nbsp; In
running before the wind, the side the leading vessel carries her
main boom is to be considered the lee side.</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;A yacht overhauling another may pass to windward
or leeward; and when near the shore or shallow water, or when
rounding any mark, flag, or buoy, <i>if the bowsprit of the yacht
astern overlap any portion of the hull of the yacht ahead</i>,
the latter must immediately give way and allow the former to pass
between her and such shore, shallow water, mark, flag, or buoy;
and should any yacht not give way or compel another to touch the
ground, or to foul any mark, flag, or buoy, the yacht so
compelling her shall forfeit all claim to the prize, her owner
shall pay all damage that may occur, and the yacht so compelled
to touch such mark, flag, or buoy shall not in this case suffer
any penalty for such contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an established rule, and should be most strictly
attended to by all yachtsmen, that where two vessels have to
cross each other on opposite tacks, the one on the starboard tack
must invariably keep her wind, and the one on the port tack must
keep away and pass to leeward, or tack short when the smallest
doubt exists of her not being able to weather the other.&nbsp;
All expenses of damage incurred by vessels on opposite tacks
running on board each other, fall upon the one on the port tack;
but where the one on the starboard tack has kept away with the
intention of passing to leeward, and they have come in contact,
the expenses of damage fall upon her on the starboard tack,
because by her keeping away she may have prevented the other
passing to leeward.&nbsp; When a vessel on the starboard tack
sees another <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>attempting to weather her, when it does not seem
possible, rather than keep away, she should put her helm down,
for the less way vessels have when they come in contact, the less
damage they will sustain.&nbsp; Should both vessels put their
helms up and run on board each other, the most fatal consequences
may arise, and therefore nothing should induce the vessel on the
starboard tack to keep away.&nbsp; All vessels going free must
give way to those on a wind.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>SHOOTING AND SKATING.</h2>
<p>This district is well worth a visit in the winter time, for
the wild-fowl shooting on the tidal portions of the rivers is
free (of course you must not trespass on the marshes for shooting
purposes, as the shooting along them is strictly
preserved).&nbsp; The usual plan is to row along the river while
your dogs work through the reeds on the bank inside the river
wall, or embankment, which generally runs parallel with the
rivers on each side.&nbsp; Flight shooting is also successfully
pursued, but of course you must obtain information as to the best
spots in the line of flight.&nbsp; Oulton Broad is free, but is
much shot over.&nbsp; Breydon Water is a capital fowling-ground
in hard winters.&nbsp; It is the &ldquo;happy hunting
ground&rdquo; of Yarmouth gunners.&nbsp; An easily managed
sailing-boat of light draught is useful for this kind of
work.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>Winter time on the Broads is very enjoyable.&nbsp;
Being so shallow, the Broads are soon frozen, and the skating is
then simply superb.&nbsp; Fancy Hickling, a lake of 400 acres,
safe all over, with the ice as clear and hard as glass, <i>and
plenty of &ldquo;elbow-room</i>&rdquo; for ice-boats as well as
skaters.</p>
<p>It would be worth while for skating parties to come down for a
few days at a time while the frosts last, instead of struggling
amid the crowds which beset London waters.</p>
<h2>FAUNA OF THE BROADS.</h2>
<p>I cannot do more than cursorily mention the abundant life
which teems amid the Broads.&nbsp; I would refer the reader, for
a full account of the life of the Broads thirty years ago and
now, to that charming book, worthy to be ranked with &ldquo;The
Complete Angler,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Natural History of
Selborne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Observations on the Fauna of Norfolk, and
more particularly on the District of the Broads,&rdquo; by the
Rev. Richard Lubbock, M.A., a new edition of which, with suitable
notes by Mr. Thomas Southwell, has lately been issued by Messrs.
Jarrold and Sons, London and Norwich.&nbsp; This book, together
with Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds of Norfolk,&rdquo; are
necessary companions to the ornithologist on the Broads.&nbsp;
For a fuller general descriptive account of the district, I may
also refer the reader to my own larger book, &ldquo;Norfolk
Broads and Rivers,&rdquo; published by Blackwood.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Of
course, water-fowl predominate.&nbsp; The heron, the
great-crested grebe, the coot and water-hen are constantly to be
seen.&nbsp; Dabchicks abound in places.&nbsp; I have seen a score
together in some open water, at Surlingham, during a frost.&nbsp;
Kingfishers are seen occasionally; water-ouzels never in the
navigable waters.&nbsp; Wild ducks, widgeon, teal, and other
ducks, gulls, terns, and waders of many species, hawks, kestrels,
marsh harriers, and hen harriers are occasionally met with,
particularly about Hickling.&nbsp; Owls, reed wrens, reed
buntings, and bearded tits (I know a colony of the latter), and
other birds occur to me as I write, but detailed lists of the
Norfolk species will be found in the &ldquo;Transactions of the
Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists&rsquo; Society&rdquo; of past
years.&nbsp; It is sufficient to say that not only in the
department of ornithology, but of entomology and botany, the
specialist will find abundant work.&nbsp; During the days and
nights I have spent in the more secluded parts of the waters, and
particularly in the very early hours after daybreak, I have
watched the habits of certain rare species, and discovered their
haunts, which I would not reveal for anything, for to do so would
be to expose them to the ravages of collectors.&nbsp; I am not a
collector myself, nor have I the remotest pretension to science,
but I am an enthusiastic student of what I may call the
&ldquo;home-life&rdquo; of birds and animals.&nbsp; Therefore I
cannot give accurate scientific information, in the shape of
lists of Broad species without borrowing from the labours of
others, <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>and the clothing the dry bones with flesh would require
more space than a guide-book will allow.&nbsp; But let a man lie
in a boat, amid the reeds, for an hour of the silvery dawn, and
watch a pair of great-crested grebes, feeding their young ones
with small fish, and teaching them to dive and catch fish also,
all so close that you might at times touch the birds with a
fishing-rod, and he will partly understand what to me is the
charm of Natural History.&nbsp; And for the romance of it there
is no place like the reed-surrounded Broad and its marshy
borders.</p>

death of Mr. Chamberlin, the owners of the Broad have obtained a
decision in the Superior Courts that the public have no right to
fish on Wroxham Broad, and although the navigation question has
not been raised, the owners claim the Broad to be private
property.&nbsp; At the same time they courteously disclaim any
intention of closing the Broad to the reasonable enjoyment of the
public.&nbsp; Sailing on the Broad is freely permitted, but
yachts are not allowed to moor there at night, on account, it is
said, of the unavoidable refuse floating against the private
pleasure grounds of the owners.&nbsp; Persons also are not
allowed to land.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that the good behaviour
of the public will remove all idea of closing the Broad to the
public, which would be nothing short of a calamity.&nbsp; The
regattas on this Broad which used to be such sources of
amusement, have been quite discontinued, partly on account of the
difficulty in getting the present racing craft up the North
River, and partly through the reluctance of yacht owners to ask
the favour of sailing where they formerly supposed they had a
right.]</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
